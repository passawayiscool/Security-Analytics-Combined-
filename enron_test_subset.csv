california update - - 10 . 02 . 01 : puc turns down davis ' proposed rate,"agreement with dwr
in what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event , the california puc today voted down davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc .
the vote was 4 - 1 , with the two republicans voting with davis ' hand - picked appointees lynch and wood .
davis ' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another davis appointee - - geoff brown - - who made a lengthy speech about why california would experience economic and political destruction if the puc did not approve davis ' proposed rate agreement .
what is davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc ?
it would remove all puc authority to review any contracts between dwr with suppliers .
it would require the puc to pass through to utility rates all dwr power contract costs , no questions asked .
what are the implications of the move by the puc to reject davis ' proposal ?
with the vote , it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the dwr power contracts .
the political pressure to re - negotiate - - or break - - the dwr power contracts is likely to intensify considerably .
it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months .
under the structure devised by davis , the revenues flowing from the cpuc / dwr rate agreement would be used to both 1 ) pay for the dwr power contracts and 2 ) service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay california ' s general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since january .
in short , there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds .
safe to say that today ' s puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis , and left his approach to "" solving "" california electricity crisis in shambles .
what next ?
a broad left - right coalition of energy interests supported a bill ( 18 xx ) that passed the legislature with broad bi - partisan support .
the bill would create a "" dedicated rate component "" on every customers bill to service the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue .
proponents of the bill - - and just about everyone else - - argue that the "" dedicated rate component "" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget .
the bill is silent , however , on how california would pay for the dwr contracts , and the bill ' s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result .
all four puc commissioners who voted against the davis rate agreement today urged davis to sign the bill . the left - right coalition ( from nader types to oil companies ) is also working hard to get davis to sign it .
davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the treasurer and bond counsel .
given today ' s vote , however , davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid .
update on edison bailout
still appears that chances are very small that edison and davis will succeed in getting the legislature to vote for an edison bailout when it returns for another "" special "" session next tuesday .
if you have any questions , just let us know .
best ,

ethylene margin collar model,"dear all :
let us meet early this afternoon .
here is the overview of the model :
1 ) the ethylene margin collars are priced using asian spread option .
the forward curve and volatility curve are provided by the desk .
the correlation between the ethylene and ethylene cost starts from the
historical spot correlation 50 % and grows with the maturity .
2 ) the overall 40 mm payout cap is modeled sepereately .
i fitted the historical spread ( 10 years data ) to a mean reverting model
with stronger mean reverting strength on the floor side . the model
produces
trajectories that are statistically simular to the historical data .
then the expected payoff is computed through simulation .
at the meeting we will discuss the assumptions and present the results .

today ' s associates prc meeting that was to begin at 1 : 30 has been cancelled
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined . both the morning
analyst prc meeting and the associates prc meeting were scheduled for the
same location and with joe sutton as chair . the analysts prc meeting is
apparently running very long , so someone from the program office called to
cancel the associates prc meeting for this afternoon . i will let you know as
soon as i know a rescheduled date .
in preparation for today ' s prc meeting , i was able to meet in person with
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities ,
accomplishments and performance . for those that were unavailable for a
meeting , we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to
accomplish the same thing . i also have any materials that you may have
provided to your supervisor for the mid - year review process , as well as
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the pep system .
with this delay in the meeting date , i have the time to ask for a copy of
your resume . the prc process clearly focuses on your performance
specifically from january through june 2000 . however , it would be helpful to
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds . please
e : mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to eb 3015 . a couple of you
have come by my office to meet with me . i would also be happy to put a name
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in

re : var for credit trading,"ted
thanks for the note - coming from jpmorgan i understand the importance of var
as a key control measure and i appreciate that we may all need to do further
work to ' institutionalise ' a var culture in enron . however , in this instance ,
i believe the initial comment has been taken out of context .
i believe there is a general communication issue here . since inception the
business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity
measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as dvolon the daily dpr .
however , no - one in rac / commercial / commercial support appears to have formally
equated that sensitivity to the business var limit during the longer than
expected delay to the completion of a signed off var model . ( informally this
is being done )
i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly
necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit
spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling
factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately .
finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading
are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting
- we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible .
i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface
issues with you next week

subject : re : var for credit trading
please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails .
the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to
adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to .
it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a
product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally
appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance
of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable .
obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it
lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that
airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the
point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to
europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var
as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any
progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one
at a time .

transwestern capacity release report for february 2002 reservation,"invoices
attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for january 2002 capacity release transactions . if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me .
fyi - based on the flash invoices i generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts , please note the following :
ena k # 24924 res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50 / 50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to burlington
conoco k # 20748 res - delete the thoreau to e . thoreau line item
conoco k # 20835 comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
texaco k # 25923 / 25924 comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4 . 5 % between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes , there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding . need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes ; and if delivery makeup scheduled , then invoice should be adjusted accordingly .
please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2 / 26 / 02 . i will review again on the lst .
schedulers - please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [ some contracts are based on calculations , especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage ] .
thanks ,

vince ,
last week i was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an enron employee . he has a phd and several years research and lab experience .
richard is afraid that being a phd is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an mba . i was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in richard , or if you feel i should encourage him to go back to school . i am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so i apologize if this request is way off base .
thank you for your help ,

dear vincent ,
as i told you on the phone on friday , i am very interested in a summer
internship at enron . i would like to point out that i want to pursue a
career in trading , and i am especially interested in derivatives . given that
enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy , broadband and weather
derivatives , i find it a company i would be most interested in working for .
i believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm , and i
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours . i have
final exams from march 19 - 22 , but would be most willing to travel to houston
for interviews any time from friday march 23 rd onwards . i hope to hear from
you soon .

we are looking at this again . there seem to be even bigger issues than accounting with the regional erc ' s , such as limited liquidity and trading volumes , extremely long transfer times for the local issuing authority to change title , etc . then , of course , barclay ' s has to agree to take them . we will push hard internally to get them in ; then start working on barclays when we have a strong story . i am not optimistic , but i do feel the pressure that you are under . shankman and mcconnell called me in to tell me what you told me last week - get all inventory off asap . i recommend that we nail down the so 2 extension before pushing barclays on other products . is that ok with you ?

re : netco,"barry would be good and i do believe that he is an asset . i will talk with wes and see what we can suggest .
with regard to your comment that i am "" in "" , in my conversation with greg whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like mark haedicke , and perhaps himself , there could be some issues with the estate and creditors committee if we were to go to netco immediately . what i agreed to with greg is that i will be focused on the estate and that i would be interested in talking about netco in 30 to 60 days . in the meantime , i will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction . i will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes , systems , staff expertise and operational controls . and you can also count on me if i can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there .
leslie reeves will be getting the org charts to tammie this afternoon before she leaves . gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts , as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts .

bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow . i will coordinate with him on org charts . where do you want to have gas logistics - under bob in operations or under trading ? given your answer , we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts .
also , i talked with bob hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to netco . i had an interesting conversation with barry pearce this morning , and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way . - - sally

subject : netco
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .
i would ask that both john and i are notified of any changes to the netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis . please forward all alterations to jeanie slone who has responsibility for the master list .
communication - i believe that the new year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on netco and what our policies are . i am asking david oxley to co - ordinate with all of you on this . i know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible .
if you are unavailable this week , please ensure you delegate this work out .
happy new year

analyst prc process,"you asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the analyst prc
process . . . i thought i would share a few things with you . the primary
concern was that an individual was representing "" our "" people , and they 1 ) did
not know them 2 ) did not know what they did 3 ) probably could not adequately
answer questions about that person and his / her performance and job
responsibilities . although i think the manager ' s in my group did an
excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments ( the two analysts
rankings in our group did not change from excellent ) , they were really uneasy
about someone independent of our group representing them .
also , in general , it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages
about the "" third "" rotation and the option of going back to school , staying
with the company , etc . i think a good idea would be to provide some clear ,
written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going
to work going forward . it surer seems like it changes every 6 months . . .
hope this helps ! let me know if you have any questions .

i am the chairman of the contract award committee of the oil ministry
here in nigeria , for security reasons , i may not wish to disclose how i
got your email address for now .
after due deliberation with my partner , i decided to forward to you
this business proposal , we want you to assist us receive the sum of
twenty eight million , six hundred thousand united state bills
( us 28 . 6 m ) into your account . this fund resulted from an over - invoiced
contract awarded by us under the budget allocation to my ministry and
the bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries . the
contract was executed , commissioned and the contractor was paid his
actual cost of the contract . now , we are left with the balance of
us 28 . 6 m as the over invoiced amount , which we have deliberately over
estimated for our own use . please note that the law forbids civil
servants to operate or own foreign accounts hence this contact , we have
agreed to share the money in the following percentages : 30 for you , 60
for us 10 for tax as may be required by your government .
note that this transaction is very much free from all sorts of risk
hence the business was carefully planned before it was successfully
executed and we the officials involved in the deal have put many years
in service to our ministry . we have been exercising patience for this
privilege for so long not until the presidential announcement last
week , that all foreign contractors owed be paid forthwith , this will
enable the presidency reconcile our debt ratio with the outside world
and to most of us , this is a lifetime blessing we cannot afford to
miss . upon indication of your interest to fully co - operate with us , a
payment application / information form will be sent to you via email for
completion .
note that the following information : a ) bankers name and address , b )
account number and account name and c ) your private phone number and
email address will enable us seek / secure approval of the fund from the
concerned government quarters / ministries within 3 - 4 banking days .
as soon as we confirm receipt of this money in your nominated bank
account , my partner and i will come over to your country to arrange for
our own share and possibly invest part of this money in your country .
let honesty and trust be our watchword throughout this transaction . i
shall furnish you with some details about myself . your prompt reply
will be highly appreciated .
best regards .

re : re [ 10 ] : greetings from london ( to enron ),"teresa ,
i would like to invite iris for an interview in houston .
she works currently in london can you call her
and ask when she is planning to visit the states .
we could pay the airfare from a location in the states .
i would hate to pay the lst class ticket from london to houston ,
though i would go for it , if necessary ( i don ' t
want a candidate to think that we are that cheap ) .
business class is a standard
for business related , cross - atlantic flights .
i would be more comfortable if you could negotiate this issue .
thanks

"investors : ossi , the next ditech , lendingtree , or countrywide ? tue , 23 mar 2004 21 : 48 : 15 - 0500","tue , 23 mar 2004 21 : 48 : 15 - 0500
equity spoltight : osf financial services - ossi
could ossi be the next ditech , lending tree , e - loan , or countrywide ? countrywide up 23 , 000 % since 1982 , 156 % in last year alone .
2003 saw one of the the biggest booms in real estate history . homeownership is at its highest level ever at 68 % , and experts are predicting 2004 will be even bigger . in fact , since 2000 the stocks of the ten financial companies that dominate mortgages have risen an average of 78 % . you have all heard of such companies as ditech , lending tree , e - loan , and countrywide . these companies are riding the current wave of record refinancing , posting record revenues and phenomenal gains . for you , the investor , it may very well be too late to get in on the ground floor of these already well - known entities . but is it too late for you to get into this market at all ? absolutely not .
osf financial services - ossi - is just now getting its legs and will soon be up and running at full speed . here is your chance to get in while the getting is good .
to illustrate the rise in stock prices per the real estate boom of 2003 , we can use as an example countrywide financial . 77 % of countrywide ' s pre - tax earnings are derived from mortg . banking . net earnings went from 842 million dollars for the 12 months ended 12 / 31 / 2002 to a whopping 2 billion , 373 million dollars for 12 months ended 12 / 31 / 2003 , with diluted earnings per share going from 4 . 87 in 2002 to 12 . 47 in 2003 .
52 - week range - 37 . 96 - 97 . 30
fourth quarter highlights include the following :
consolidated net earnings reached 564 million dollars , advancing 121 percent over fourth quarter last year .
earnings per diluted share increased 89 percent over last year to 2 . 74 , the company ' s second highest quarter on record . notably , the company ' s liquid yield option notes became convertible during the fourth quarter , resulting in an upswing in the number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter of 10 . 4 million . this had a dilutive effect on fourth quarter earnings of 0 . 14 per share and on annual earnings of 0 . 17 per share .
pre - tax earnings from diversified businesses were 246 million dollars , a gain of 122 percent over last year ' s fourth quarter .
incredible gains .
countrywide financial was established in 1969 , but you can see an astounding rise in stock value came last year , coinciding with a never before seen real estate boom . just last year alone stock value was up an est . % 156 .
according to shawn tully from fortune magazine :
most amazing of all is that countrywide boasts the best stock market performance of any financial services company in the fortune 500 , measured from the start of the great bull market over two decades ago . during that period , it has delivered investors a 23 , 000 % returnyes , 23 , 000 % or 30 % a year , so that shareholders now have over $ 230 , 000 for every $ 1 , 000 they invested in late 1982 . it handily beat superstars wamu , wal - mart , and warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway ( all around 15 , 000 % ) .
the time has come and gone to get in early with countrywide , but the time is right for ossi .

california update 3 / 29 / 01,"? socal and pg & e have both made payments to the state of california ( dwr ) for power purchases per the puc order on tuesday . socal made a payment on wednesday of $ 43 . 5 m for purchases between january 19 - february 11 and pg & e paid $ 61 m .
? attorney general , bill lockyer , has ruled that the media does not have the right to view the long - term power contracts being negotiated .
? senator burton stated on the senate floor this morning that legislators need to set their regular session bill unrelated to energy quickly because there would be no rule waivers . he also noted that there would probably not be a lot of money for anything besides energy , and therefore a lot of bills would probably die in policy committee .
? in a conference call on tuesday , socal stated to a group of commercial paper holders that it would pay back interest on its commercial paper , which is approximately $ 30 m . one commercial holder said that since there is no default rate specified in the paper , the default rate should automatically be 10 % under california law . the socal representative replied "" we don ' t think that applies to us . "" in other words , socal does not plan on paying an added default rate on top of the interest payments .
? at this time , the legislature announced they would probably not be taking their easter break , scheduled for the week of april 9 th . according to a source , burton is not allowing any passes for any travel or absences . hertzberg has gone a step farther and said that any travel has to approved by his office and the member themselves has to come to his office to pick up the tickets . some believe this maybe an attempt to push the republicans into breaking the stalemate on ab 8 x ( voted down last friday ) currently being debated in the assembly .",0

personnel and contracts,"louise ,
- ubs is planning to tell all of those who are offered positions to come to work at the houstonion on friday , not at the enron building . at the houstonian , they will have a series of presentations on the new company . i raised concerns about this last night :
- having the ubs offerees offsite means that everyone left in the building is effectively told they are not a first - round pick .
- those who remain in the building will have little to do but sit and feed off each other ' s discontent .
- some of the initial offerees may refuse , in which case we then have to go back to a discontent estate person to offer them a position . this makes it very obvious to them and all their peers that they were a second - round draft choice .
i have suggested that they either accelerate the contracting process so we know that we have everyone before friday , or else delay the friday meeting . the friday meeting was stated as necessary so that everyone could understand their benefits before signing . this doesn ' t sound like a good reason to me .
- i am told i will be approached today by someone from ubs hr . i assume this is what you warned me about and that my "" real "" contract / meeting will be with you .
- ubs wants me to sign before they offer positions to others within enrononline . this doesn ' t make sense , but if true , can we meet as soon as possible ? i ' d like to make sure my people have their offers asap ( for the above reasons ) , but i ' d also like a little time to think about the offer you have in mind for me .
- i remain concerned that the people who were previously offered retention bonuses will be in a position to walk away at the end of feb . we are in a position where the critical people will be free to go , while the less critical people are incentivised to stay for 6 months .

subject : working together on the valuation model
all ,
as we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model ( due late next week or early the next for the offsite ) , it is important that we all understand and embrace some basic ground rules . i ' ve got some suggestions below and would like to hear any that you have :
in order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the betterment of us all - i think we ought to give one person version control responsibility over the model . this person should be advised when the model is updated . relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons for the updating also seem pertinent . version control is critical if we are to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management .
related to this , rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to upper management ( both sally and greg ) and be given the opportunity to give feedback before hand .
just basic stuff , but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we go much further , we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications .
thanks ,
fred

beaumont methanol - meter 1428 - october 2000,"ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .

national petroleum corporation ( s . n . p . c ) and a member
of contract tenders board of the same parastatal . your
highly valued contact was reliably introduced to me at
the foreign chamber of commerce and
industry in my search for a reliable individual and
company who can handle a strictly confidential
transaction , which involves transfer of reasonable sum
of money to a foreign account .
this money results from various contracts awarded by
our corporation on behalf of the federal government ,
which was deliberately over invoiced to the tune of
$ 11 . 500 . 000 . 00 ( eleven million five hundred thousand
united states dollars ) . after the completion and
commissioning of the contract , the contractual sum was
paid to the contractors , leaving the over invoiced
sum in the reserve account with the bank . we
therefore require the partnership of a foreigner or
foreign firm to assist us in form of a trustee and
provide a save and reliable account for this transfer .
in the last meeting with my colleagues , it was
unanimously agreed that 30 % of the total sum would be
given to you . 60 % for me and my colleagues while 10 %
will be used to reimburse the expenses that may be
incurred during the course of this transaction . i
assure you , that this transaction is 100 % one hundred
percent risk free as we have concluded every
arrangement to protect the interest of everyone
involved . likewise all modalities for the successful
transfer of this money have been worked out with the
finance ministry and the bank to facilitate the
remittance of this money to any designated bank
account .
however , i will want to believe that you are honest
enough and will not raise any misgiving with respect
to this transaction . more importantly , you will keep
this transaction very confidential so as not to
jeopardize ones reputation and ambition .
please am waiting for your reply through my email

subject : mg : russian prepayment exposure
interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by tim -
says a lot about the way mg do business i think .
re ny we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( philip
bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a dash for each prepayment on a
contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in ny and we may have
some issues - although marcelo and others stressed the fact that concentrates
appeared to move no product without a letter of credit , which was then often
discounted to realise cash ! !
shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment
yesterday from philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were
' unique ' - whilst i can accept that each may be tailored to customer
preferences - they still need to be cacsed - we should look at the
enforceability / legal risk here .
whilst information prepayment risk for metals should come from london -
accessing any relevent inofrmation from ny may be helpful
will call later !

subject : mg : russian prepayment exposure
the situation at present is as follows :
mg have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper
from the russian federation on a prepayment basis
all contracts are on a floating price basis ( lme less discount )
notional value of each contract is circa $ 0 . 5 - 3 mm
prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis , for between 90 - 95 % value
with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents
the issues break down into three broad areas :
1 ) commercial
at present enron does not engage in prepayment activities with russian
federation counterparties .
no further prepayments are permitted until rac have performed a dash for this
activity . as this is likely to take several weeks howard will liase with
commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising
from this suspension . howard and david hardy will also take immediate steps
to manage down existing prepayment exposures .
2 ) legal
based on a cursory review of the confirmations by robert , if we are to
continue this activity legal need to instructed to perform a full review for
several reasons , including :
the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms ,
e . g . pricing date
they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments , and are generally not
constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity .
"" conditions of purchase "" are attached to the confirmations which refer to
english law , but as they are not always countersigned , under conflict rules
the closest or real connection may be deemed to be russian law which , in the
absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability .
there are several "" open "" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are
beyond the delivery period , and which could be considered to have been
discharged by breach . again the confirmation does not contain adequate
language .
3 ) credit / operational
there are no formal counterparty limits . nor are prepayment and volumetric
exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis . this information is
necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance , and needs to be
factored into the overall credit monitoring process .
david has requested this information from mg , and will follow up this one off
exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track
exposures based on the methodology developed for helsinki .
further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that ,
despite the issues identified with contractual terms , there is performance
against the contracts . david is pursuing this from a credit perspective and
will report back to his group his findings by friday latest .
the issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to
accelerate a planned review of contract language for all mg ' s activities in
all jurisdictions . mike and i will discuss bringing this review forward with
justin .
any questions , please call .

optical network engineering & enron research offsite meeting,"hi john , as per our discussion and e - mails , i am suggesting the following
dates for the subject offsite : april 14 & 15 th ( friday & sat ) . place and
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up . the heads of each group will
decide who will attend . we would also invite kevin hannon , scott yeager , tom
gros , ted seitz and jean mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by
the technical folks .
as before , the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups
within enron and to exchange ideas and issues . the enron research team will
provide trading and modeling presentations and the optical network
engineering team will present networking and components related topics .
take away from the two days will be to provide john griebling ' s group with
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general
and energy markets in particular via enron ( i . e . , how the sausage was
made ! ) . likewise , john ' s group will provide us with better understanding of
optical networking from a technical perspective . particularily , how ebs is
planning to develop the puplic switched optical network ( pson ) that john has
' branded ' our pooling point based network !
please reply asap if these two days ( april 14 & 15 ) will work . additionally ,
john , is the original suggestion to hold it in scott yeager ' s cabin somewhere
up in colorado mts . still holds ? if yes , i should probably let scott know !
if not , i ' ll try to find other places - - any suggestions , anyone ?
regards ,

peoples gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "" adequate assurances of payment "" , as stated in their tariff . they will continue to accept a parental guaranty , which is due no later than december 3 ( and which teresa says is being processed ) . the amount at issue is about $ 40 k .

re : research sign off,"steve ,
sign - off from the research group is something that requires defining formal
rules going forward .
my concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions
to sign - off on partial results of valuation , without the benefits of a full
picture .
sometimes , we were asked to sign - off on trade ideas , over which we have no
control long - term .
i shall talk to rick buy and david port about setting up more formal rules
for the research sign - off .

subject : research sign off
hi sharad
i note from our discussion earlier this morning that you ' ve been asked to
sign off a calculation from another group , which is something we ' re asked to
do from time to time .
i take the view that we in research can assess a computation in terms of what
it achieves with respect to its requirements , what its shortfalls are , and
therefore what the risks associated with using this method are . we cannot
provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to enron , which i
feel falls firmly within rac territory .
this then raises the question of can research sign off anything for other
groups after all ? to "" sign off "" means to accept something , which our opinion
in itself cannot do . it is most appropriate for us to provide a technical
note outlining the methodology , risks and shortcomings of a method , leaving
the formal "" sign off "" to those best placed to assess these risks for our
company . the alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view
on what is acceptable risk for the company .

out weekend plans . i want to reiterate that , although it would be great to
have you here , please don ' t make it too hard on yourself . don ' t pressure
yourself to come ; i will totally understand if you do not . if you don ' t
come this weekend , i bet you will be here soon anyway - because this tummy
is sure to erupt in the near future ! either way is great .
just had to go get some more clothes ( at motherhood ) . . . since i am

"" or something like that . is there any problem with that ? second , the jeffs ( fawcett and dasovich ) and perhaps others will be talking to danny shortly about a possible next phase expansion into california . someone please take point on passing info from that meeting on to shelley and mkm and me . shelley may want to have stan tell madden that we are looking at an additonal large expansion beyond the one we are about to file . the pr mileage might be useful but shelley will need to know as much as we can disclose outside about what we are up to . if we get serious about looking at something that goes beyond the cal border we may want to hold that internally for a while and not tell madden . on the other hand , i don ' t have any problem with stan telling madden that we have general concerns about whether pipe expansions within california will keep pace with interstate expansions to the border . jeff d ' s analogy of the "" four lane superhighway turning into a dirt road "" is too good not to use with madden ! df

cc : maria pavlou / et & s / enron , lee huber / et bid accordingly
- bids will be evaluated based on highest rate .
- minimum term is 5 years .
- if there are tie bids that all qualify as highest rate and quantities bid upon exceed quantity available , the tie bids will be allocated pro rata .
- shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have their bid capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary .
- bids should include : 1 ) service request and 2 ) offer letter stating material terms ( rate , term , points , quantity ) . offer is binding . it can include a regulatory "" out , "" but cannot be "" subject to management approval . ""
the only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the nov . open season in a timely fashion . ( drew , i found out this includes calpine ) .
explanation :
the commercial group decided ( pending steve harris ' s approval ) that they prefer the "" highest rate with a minimum stated term "" over highest net present value because it is consistent with stan ' s stated preference for "" front loading "" the contracts . in other words , a shipper that bids $ 0 . 60 for 5 years beats a shipper that bids $ 0 . 35 for 15 years because it has bid the highest rate .

alejandro dacosta ; manifest que en materia de remodelacin y restauracin es sumamente difcil comprobar inversiones ; quiz por ello el instituto del patrimonio cultural del estado de oaxaca no ha informado con detalle cuantos millones de pesos se invertirn en el zcalo , solo ha dicho que son 800 millones de pesos para todo el centro histrico , pero son obras que la ciudadana no considera prioritarias .
cuestion que se invirtieron recursos pblicos en la remodelacin del ex palacio de gobierno , que despus ser destinado a museo ; la ex casa de gobierno se remodela para destinarla a hotel escuela ; al ex recinto legislativo tambin se le invierte dinero para condicionarlo como teatro , mientras en las colonias populares miles de familias se encuentran sin agua potable , alumbrado publico y drenaje .
sostuvo que el zcalo de la ciudad , es lugar especial en el mundo , por que all se renen personas de diversas clases sociales ; es un centro de reunin de la memoria colectiva .
claudia turren ; dijo que el comit de vigilancia ciudadana del zcalo de la ciudad de oaxaca determin concretar sus esfuerzos para generar un proyecto de restauracin de los rboles ; el aspecto de la piedra que utilizaran en los trabajos de remodelacin , el nivel del piso ser responsabilidad de otro grupo de ciudadanos vigilar .
donde est el pinochochetazo ?
estos dos arquitectos dijeron en otra entrevista que los trabajos segn su experiencia si estarian terminados para el 18 de julio ; y por la informacion que tenemos al no conseguir el trabajo completo de remodelacion , aceptaron ser los asesores del instituto del patrimonio cultural .
 como se atreven a decir que es tarea de otros ciudadanos vigilar los niveles , el tipo de piedra que se esta utilizando en el piso del zocalo y al mismo tiempo hacer los cuestionamientos antes citados ?
 si son unicamente los rboles laureles del z?calo el tema de de este comit de vigilancia ciudadana !
 que les importa a los miembros de este comit lo que el gobierno haga o no con las dems obras ?
que les importa que la gente tenga o no agua potable , alumbrado publico y drenaje ?
que les importa la cantidad de dinero que gasten ?
? qu , el partido politico de este comit de vigilancia ciudadana , - convergencia - tiene una moral en el uso de los recursos publicos ?

apel was wondering whether enron could have an interest in marketing the power and / or the diesel fuel . apel also would be open to suggestions should enron wish to be involved in other ways .
the principals apel are in houston this week and could meet with enron this thursday afternoon , 19 july .
john , would or your colleagues like to meet with apel this thursday , and if so , what time and where would be convenient ?
thanks and best regards ,

dear ms . crenshaw :
i recently accepted a quant position with texaco in houston . lara berry
from enron contacted me just after that , and i told her of the situation .
i agreed to send her my resume ( which i did ) and keep in touch .
enron is a fabulous corporation with exciting opportunities . mr . kaminski
is very well known in the energy field , and i have read some of his
material . i am extremely pleased that you all would be interested in me ;
however , i have given my word to texaco .
the texaco position offers a lot of opportunity and risk . this is the kind
of challenge for which i am looking . if things do not work out , however , i
would definitely contact enron again and cherish any opportunity for an
interview .
thank you very much ,

california update - 9 / 4 / 2001,"executive summary
? several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the edison mou .
? a snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome .
procedural scenarios
assembly
the assembly appropriations committee ' s plan to take up sb 78 xx today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full assembly on a party line vote . while the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of friday ' s draft bill , it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend . if the problematic "" shaver lake "" provisions are removed from the bill , assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill ( although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition ) . if the shaver lake amendments remain , several central valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee .
assembly speaker bob hertzberg supports this edison deal , and the business community supports some recent amendments . this likely mitigates concerns from other pro - business democrats . with or without the shaver lake provisions , hertzberg should get at least 41 democratic members ( and probably a few more ) , but no more than 2 republicans ( if any ) to vote aye on the bill . hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass , and there are 50 democrats in his caucus . if the vote is close , a personal plea from him and / or the governor should enable him to get to 41 .
senate
the bill would next move to the senate for approval of the assembly ' s amendments . this is where the prognosticating gets difficult . senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb 78 xx . gov . davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal , but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed ( due to a variety of factors ) , and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position .
this would lead to one of four scenarios :
? burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate , and no edison mou bill is approved before sept . 15 th ,
? burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition ( this option is unlikely ) ,
? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill ( as it is passed by the assembly ) for a vote in the full senate with his support ,
? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg , but as part of the deal , he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the assembly for more amendments , and another vote in the assembly - before a vote in the senate .
john burton is considered one of the smartest , and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today , so it is problematic to guess his next move . additionally , external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result . for instance , the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue that burton cares more about resolving his way ( e . g . workers compensation benefits , drug courts , reapportionment ) . foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult . but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him , and given burton ' s past actions , he may string them along , holding out for several days ( maybe even until sept . 14 th ) before he agrees to anything .
governor
assuming the bill escapes the senate ( and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes ) the governor will almost certainly sign it , regardless of edison ' s public position . the bill will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs it .
consumer groups have vowed to undo any "" edison bailout "" enacted into law by way of the ballot box . that could be either ( 1 ) an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb 78 xx and replacing it with other provisions , or ( 2 ) a referendum to repeal sb 78 xx , making it as if the bill was never passed at all .
initiative
once drafted and submitted to the attorney general , it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary , and another 25 days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary . after either the 15 or 40 days , the attorney general sends it to the proponents , the senate , the assembly , and the secretary of state . the day it is mailed is called the summary date . that is the day upon which all calculations are made .
the proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures . however , the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters . therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election , on march 5 , 2002 ( statewide primaries ) , and so , could not qualify until the statewide general election on november 5 , 2002 . however the window is tight for that election , as well , and a proposal would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september 2001 to qualify for november 2002 .
the legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative , but cannot amend it . so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot . an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the preceding gubernatorial election ( 419 , 260 signatures ) . the ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers . it seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly , but harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer & consumer rights has been successful at placing pro - consumer initiatives on the ballot before , including prop . 9 in 1998 , which sought to undo ab 1890 before the public understood its ramifications .
referendum
referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives , although a successful referendum was on the march 7 , 2000 ballot . prior to that , the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the june 1982 primary election ballot . all four were defeated . since 1912 , there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot . of the 50 attempts , 39 qualified for the ballot , 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect . the circulation calendar , verification , timing , and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives . for example , the california constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred . the signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute , though .
political dynamics
notwithstanding the governor ' s and assembly speaker ' s desire to enact an edison rescue package , senate president pro tem john burton is in the driver ' s seat . in fact , as noted above , there is a perception among some that it is the governor who needs burton and not the other way around . one business source close to the negotiations believes burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an edison bailout . in fact , members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility , their reluctance fed by generators ' lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout .
currently , due largely to this dynamic and others such as the shaver lake issue , there are not 41 votes for an edison rescue in the assembly . we believe this will change as the governor and the speaker exert their influence , and the bill will pass the assembly . as difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the assembly , the state senate presents an even larger challenge . however , at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an edison rescue package being approved by the state senate are less than 50 percent .",0

dear sir ,
i would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and
success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained
in this letter .
before going into details of my proposal to you , i must first implore
you to treat with the utmost confidentiality as this is required for
its success and to have faith in this transaction , for opportunities
like this only comes to one once in a life time .
my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of
my country ' s contracts review panel ( crp ) who are interested in
diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of
the apex bank of my country . in order to commence this transaction , we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated
account the said floating funds . we are determined to conclude the
transfer before the end of this quarter of 2005 .
the source of the funds are as follows : during the last military regime
in my country , government officials set up companies and awarded
themselves contracts that were grossly over - invoiced in various
ministries and parastatals . the present civilian government set up the
contract review panel , which has the mandate to use the instruments of
payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel , to
review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed
outstanding amounts .
my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds
which are presently floating in our ( apex ) central bank ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes .
however , by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of
this panel , we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names
of companies that are based in my country .
i have therefore been mandated , as a matter of trust by my colleagues in
the panel , to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account
we can transfer the sum of u . s . $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( twenty million , five
hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) . that is why i am seeking your
assistance . we have agreed to share the money to be transferred into
your account , if you agree with our proposition as follows ;
( i ) 25 % to the account owner ( you ) .
( ii ) 65 or us ( the panel officials ) .
( iii ) 10 % to be used in settling all expenses ( by both you and us )
incidental to the actualization of this project .
we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to
have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home . please
note that this transaction is 100 % safe and risk - free .
we intend to effect the transfer within fourteen ( 14 ) banking days from
the date of receipt of the following information through the ifax
number stated above : your company ' s name , address , telephone and fax
numbers we will use your company ' s name to apply for the payment and
backdate the award of the contract in favour of your company .
we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we
solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction .
i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when
i hear from you .
please get in touch through my ifax # 15094618096 . or my alternative
email address : crp _ ng 2005 @ yahoo . com

re : fw : mtg . scheduled,"frank ,
regarding simulating power prices in var we might discuss the following items
and show some results :
1 . clustering for power :
- clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them ;
- geographical clustering ;
- flexibility in choosing "" core curves "" ( based on position size ) ;
2 . jump - diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month :
- parameter estimation from historical data ( do we want to use it ? )
- working out parameters ( jumps frequency , jump size ) as stress scenarios ;
3 . correlations within a cluster and across clusters .
4 . changing correlations estimations ( using fixed contact ' time series ) .
5 . joint estimation of factors for selected regions .
let me know what you think should be in the agenda for this meeting .

i thought more about our phone conversation last night . based on what you said and assuming this document is ok , count me in . sorry my reaction was not as positive as you hoped but your comment about not being able to discuss who is on the team with anyone caught me off guard . i don ' t believe i have any issues with financial terms that you said ( again i want to see what it looks in writing ) . i still don ' t fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 50 % of the commercial people is all that we end up , this shop will still be better than any other on the street . i guess get me this document to look at when ever you can .

cc : dornan , dari ; kirk , steve ; fossum , drew ; miller , mary kay
subject : negotiated rates
pursuant to our conversation yesterday , here are some guidelines for the northern marketers to follow when doing above - maximum rate negotiated rate transactions .
the commission permits a pipeline to charge above - maximum rates under negotiated rate authority provided that the capacity also remains available at the maximum recourse rate . in other words , we cannot unilaterally require a customer to purchase capacity at a rate above the max rate ; however , customers may willingly choose to pay a negotiated rate ( above max rates or below minimum rates ) .
below are some faqs and the appropriate response when negotiating rates with customers in an above - maximum rate environment .
1 . is it better to use a fixed rate or an index / formula based rate ? it is better to use an index or formula based negotiated rate as opposed to a fixed rate , as the index or formula - based rates provide a reasonable basis as to why a customer would enter into a negotiated rate transaction exceeding max rates , e . g . to accommodate the customer ' s risk profile .
2 . who should propose the rate ? it is better for the customer to propose the rate . you may ask questions like : have you seen the spread ? what do you think ? what can you give me for the subject capacity ? will you split the upside ? if so , what is a fair split ? the goal here is to have the customer come up with the rate . if the customer won ' t go there , it is never appropriate to bully , cajole , or use undue pressure to get an above - maximum rate deal . moreover , we can never imply or otherwise indicate that the capacity is unavailable if the customer does not pay a negotiated rate or above - maximum rate .
3 . do i have to offer the maximum rate or say this capacity is also available at the maximum rate ? our capacity is always offered at the maximum tariff rate because that is the rate on file which the shipper sees when he / she looks at our tariff . we don ' t have to expressly state the capacity is available at our maximum recourse rate , but if the customer requests to pay the maximum rate , no further conversations about paying a negotiated rate should take place . in other words , we have to sell available capacity at the maximum rate once a shipper asks for that rate unless we are negotiating a longer term maximum rate deal for such capacity at the same time . in such circumstances , please confer with regulatory and legal so that we can determine what action is appropriate to take given the specific facts .
4 . can a shipper get a higher priority by paying more than the maximum rate ? no . shippers willing to pay more than the maximum recourse rate are considered to have paid the maximum recourse rate for capacity allocation and priority purposes . a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate . where there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available , the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate on the allocation basis required by the tariff .
given that customers have recorded phone lines , be careful what you say . we cannot deny the availability of capacity at the recourse rate , nor can we mislead customers into believing that the maximum rate is unavailable for certain capacity for any reason .",0

progress since your email - we did have a meeting too with the owners of the turbine book ( calger , jacoby and wiggs ) last thursday . clearly we are pursuing all avenues to sell , mitigate , place as many of the turbines as soon as possible . i am also suggesting that we look as to whether we could negotiate a cancellation with mitsubishi .
ben can provide you with more detail of where we are with each customer , if you want a copy of what they gave me let me know . but generally i probably want rid of these turbines more than anyone .

we are presently working with jody pierce to get the accounting system for the turbine book in place , and a turbine report form prepared . we will have this to you in the next 10 business days . the only recent news is the sale of the steam turbine for $ 400 k , and that we intend to utilize an outside consulting firm ( navigant ) to enhance our ability to get some interest going on the sw 501 d 5 a . lastly , we are reviewing the possibility of having the ft . pierce project use mhi unit # 3 instead of unit # 1 in light of the apparent market interest in units 1 and 2 , and the current ft . pierce construction schedule which is better suited for unit # 3 than unit # 1 .
mike coleman is putting together a budget and program to monitor ( from a technical perspective ) and maintain the 501 d 5 a and the 501 fs .
please let me know if you have any other questions .

with the shipment of two of the four units from mhi scheduled for august and no viable place to ship them , our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly . we need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position .
based on discussion with a number of people , i would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible . john garrison has identified a number of potential buyers , and i believe that brett wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak .
we should inform mhi that we will now target unit 3 for fort pierce , given the slowdown in the fort pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from mhi on unit 1 . if we also drop the dual fuel requirement for fort pierce , we should provide some project savings to that project . prior to informing mhi , we shoud have jackson chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs .
i also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for tallahassee , unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3 rd unit to a buyer . in the next three weeks we will review tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project .
finally , mhi has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from august 2 to the end of august . i think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly , given that we can ' t tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an august 2 ship date . we should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date .
probably everyone knows some of this , and some know all of this , but hopefully the overall picture is of value .
thanks !

weather desk ' s idea is probably different ? ) : ? for the one day , $ 1100 per
person . ? if you think that there will be ? around 10 people or more , then we
can offer a day rate , regardless of the number of people . ?

also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training

recommendation for john gordon,"dear vince ,
i am writing to bring to your attention a gsia student , john gordon , who is
currently being considered for enron ' s associates program . my understanding
is that mark courtney and andrew miles at enron are championing john as a
late addition to the program .
while i know enron doesn ' t routinely recruit at gsia , john would be an ideal
candidate if you are willing to make an exception . he is a terrific finance
student with a strong transcript ; including an a + in my options class . since
john has an engineering / energy background , he asked early on for additional
background reading about finance and energy . john is personable and
outgoing . normally the job market for someone of john ' s caliber would have
already cleared , but i have been told that there are dual career issues at
play here .
i would be very appreciative if you would take a look at john . a copy of
his resume is attached to this email .
best regards ,
duane

i have a premonition that you could be trusted to assist me in
effecting a fund transfer into your nominated account . as such i
strongly believe it that
you will not sit on our fund when it finally gets into your nominated
account .
you see , we are top officials of the federal government contract
review panel who are interested in importation of goods into our
country with funds which are presently trapped in nigeria in order to
commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said trapped funds .
the source of this fund is as follows : - during the last regime here ,
some government officials set up companies and awarded themselves
contracts which were grossly over - invoiced in various ministries .
the present government set up a contract review panel and we have
identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are presently
floating in the central bank of nigeria ready for payment .
however , by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of
the panel , we cannot acquire this money in our names . i have therefore ,
been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the panel to
look
for an oversea partner into whose account we would transfer the sum
of us $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( twenty million , five hundred thousand unitedstates
dollars ) only .
hence we are writing you this letter , we have agreed to share the
money thus :
1 ) 25 % for the account owner ( you )
2 ) 70 % for the officials ( us )
3 ) 5 % will be for settling of taxation and all local and foreign
expenses . it is from the 70 % that we wish to commence the said
business .
we would want you to furnish us with your full particulars such as your
name , telephone numbers , fax numbers , please

is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which
discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to
value these options
first , some additional information .
option characteristics :
- - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company )
- - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated
- - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or
turkish lire )
we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75
per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on
december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds )
are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at
$ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due
to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise
all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early
oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by
repricing the options strike higher while extending their term .
we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to
use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most
appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s
historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use
( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy )
a few key points :
- - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to
be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future
options intrinsic value in 3 years
( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but
the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation )
- - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we
have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return
- - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount
- - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we
obviously do not exercise .
we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able
to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and
the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach
our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market
and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing
that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the
non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option
volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel
rac ' s approach is double counting .
if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a
call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information .

dear dr . kaminski ,
how are you ? i seemed to have lost contact with you . the last contact
was with a ms . graham - regarding my coming to houston for an interview -
while i was still living in london .
i am now back in the states - where i spent the last few months working
for a dot . com . although this internet opportunity was interesting , it was
not a viable one . i guess part of the technology firm shake out .
therefore i am now interviewing again - with investment banks and
insurance companies . is enron still interested in having me come down for
an interview ? if so , please let me know how to proceed .
thank you in advance for your time and consideration .
kind regards ,
iris mack

preliminary agenda
cost estimate
outside speaker options
i am holding 3 enron aircraft for this event and have included that price in the cost estimate .
i have reviewed all the video tapes for the outside speakers with the exception of the political humorists . the only one that i would not recommend is joe malarkey . i thought his material was ' pure malarkey ' - but that is just my opinion . i have bios if you would like to see them . we are not limited to this list - i can check pricing and availability for anyone that you would like to suggest .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments .

pastoria - kern,"calpine just confirmed the following : tomorrow they will commit to 50 - 100 per day of kern expansion . they will commit 100 / day if enron commits to take 50 of it if the project sale does not close . if enron does not commit to the 50 , they will only go in for 50 and enron will not have any rights to it .
bottom line - we have gone from needing to commit to 100 / day of transport to 0 - 50 per day . we will need to decide on this tomorrow morning .

follow up on transport pv quantities,"the following table summarizes the pv quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the navy yard . you may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates ( unitized ) on the value of the transaction . because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price , an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal .
as a reminder , the base valuation makes very reasonable ( and conservative ) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal .

afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
houston ( afx ) - enron corp said its creditor banks have granted an extension on a 690 mln usd note payable by nov 27 until mid - december , giving it enough time to restructure the debt .
in a statement , the troubled energy company said the extension has been agreed following talks with its main creditor banks on restructuring its debt to avoid a liquidity crisis .
"" we have been in continuous contact with our banks and believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position , strengthen our balance sheet and address upcoming maturities , "" said chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon .
enron first informed investors of the possibility it would be forced to repay the 690 mln usd note in a filing to the securities and exchange commission on monday .
the obligation arose after standard & poor ' s cut the company ' s long - term debt rating to bbb - last week , forcing it to either post collateral on the note or repay it on maturity .
enron said it has also secured the remaining 450 mln usd of a previously announced 1 bln usd credit line from jp morgan and salomon smith barney . the facility is secured by the assets of enron ' s northern natural gas co unit .
the other 550 mln usd are secured by the assets of its transwestern pipeline co .
enron also said it is still committed to its merger with dynegy inc , announced on nov 9 .
"" we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders , employees , and lenders , "" said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay . "" it offers the opportunity to create a formidable player in the merchant energy business with substantial growth prospects and a strong financial position . ""
jp morgan chase vice chairman james lee said the bank will work with enron and its other creditor banks "" to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy "" , which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2002 .

houston ( ap ) - shares of embattled enron corp . plunged another 32 percent wednesday morning as analysts and investors continued to doubt the once - mighty energy trader ' s ability to recover lost business and investor confidence .
in a report released wednesday , goldman sachs & co . analyst david fleischer became the latest to question enron ' s future , saying that an sec filing by the houston - based company earlier this week "" raised new issues about liquidity and the ability of the company to even finance itself over the next several months . ""
analysts are also questioning whether dynegy inc . ' s planned dlrs 8 . 9 billion acquisition of enron will survive given the latest revelations .
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission by enron late monday restated the company ' s third - quarter earnings and stated that it may have to repay a dlrs 690 million debt by next week because of decreased credit ratings .
the filing also noted that enron ' s financial woes have led to a "" reduced level of transaction activity "" with the company by trading partners .
enron shares fell 23 percent tuesday , then dropped another dlrs 2 . 25 , or 32 percent , to dlrs 4 . 74 wednesday in extremely heavy trading on the new york stock exchange .
fleischer said enron ' s nov . 16 cash balance of dlrs 1 . 2 billion is inadequate to meet remaining debt obligations .
fleischer acknowledged , however , enron ' s efforts to renegotiate next week ' s due date for the dlrs 690 million debt , which was triggered nov . 12 when the company ' s credit rating was downgraded to bbb - , saying that there are indications that enron ' s banks may be willing to roll current maturities over and even make new equity investments .
michelle foss , director of the energy institute at the university of houston , said this latest round of troubles had to raise concerns about whether the dynegy - enron deal will be pulled off .
"" it doesn ' t look like it ' s going to be able to happen , "" foss said . "" it did look like a decent idea when they proposed the merger , but today i ' m sure they ' ll look at it and see if they can salvage their attempt to buy enron . ""
shares of dynegy were off dlrs 2 . 55 to dlrs 39 . 15 in trading on the nyse .

tobacco suits by venezuela , brazil ' s espirito santo dropped
miami ( ap ) - health care cost - recovery lawsuits against major u . s . cigarette makers by venezuela and the brazilian state of espirito santo have been dismissed .
"" this is another important reminder to american plaintiffs ' lawyers that a state court won ' t ignore the overwhelming number of decisions by federal courts rejecting these lawsuits , "" william s . ohlemeyer , philip morris cos . vice president , said tuesday after the decisions .
attorneys for several foreign governments have filed an assortment of lawsuits in u . s . federal and state courts in an attempt to find some legal mechanism that withstands judicial scrutiny .
russia and other brazilian states are among the foreign governments that have sued in miami , where a verdict of dlrs 145 billion was awarded to florida smokers against the five biggest u . s . cigarette makers .
ecuador ' s suit in miami was withdrawn earlier when another state judge announced his intention to dismiss it .

enron gets extension on $ 690 mln note due next week ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 21 12 : 38 ( new york )
enron gets extension on $ 690 mln note due next week ( updatel )
( updates with amount of debt in fourth paragraph . )
houston , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , whose shares had
dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis , said lenders
extended to mid - december the payment date on a $ 690 million note
due next week .
enron , which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader
dynegy inc . in a transaction now valued at more than $ 23 billion ,
said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to
repay the $ 690 million note . the repayment would strain cash
reserves enron needs to back its trading operations , investors and
analysts said .
the houston - based company didn ' t say in its release who holds
the note , which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns
brazilian natural - gas assets and was backed by enron .
the note is held by a group of banks led by the citibank unit
of citigroup inc . , standard & poor ' s said in a press release
yesterday .
enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a
restructuring of its debt , the company said in a statement
distributed by pr newswire .
` ` we believe the interests of chase and enron ' s other primary
lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort , ' ' james lee ,
vice president of jp morgan chase & co . , said in the enron
statement . ` ` we will work with enron and its other primary lenders
to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to
and through its merger with dynegy . ' ' morgan has been advising
enron on its merger with dynegy .
enron said yesterday it may have to pay $ 9 . 15 billion in debt
due by 2003 , suggesting the company may run out of cash before the
merger closes . dynegy has said the merger should close before the
end of the third quarter of 2002 .
enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $ 2
billion in cash or credit lines .

enron , dynegy shares fall 2 nd day on threat to buyout ( update 2 )
( adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph . )
houston , nov . 21 , ( bloomberg ) - - shares of enron corp . , the
biggest energy trader , and dynegy inc . fell for a second day on
concern enron may run out of cash before its takeover by dynegy
can be completed .
enron tumbled as much as 33 percent , and dynegy dropped as
much as 6 . 7 percent . enron ' s bonds also fell . the company ' s 6 . 4
percent notes maturing in july 2006 were bid at 62 cents and
offered at 66 cents , traders said . they sold at about 72 cents
yesterday .
institutional investors sold shares of both companies after
goldman , sachs & co . analyst david fleischer downgraded them to
` ` market perform ' ' from his ` ` recommend ' ' list , other analysts
said .
the dynegy bid ` ` did not eliminate customer concerns about
enron ' s liquidity and long - term viability , ' ' goldman sachs said
in its report . ` ` we now believe that it will be difficult for
enron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that
enron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide
cash or letters of credit to back routine transactions . ' '
fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for enron to 50
cents from $ 1 . 35 . enron had been expected to make $ 1 . 90 next
year , the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by thomson
financial / first call .
enron said monday it may have to pay $ 9 . 15 billion in debt
due by 2003 , suggesting the houston - based energy trader may run
out of cash . the company said in a regulatory filing it has less
than $ 2 billion in cash or credit lines .
it also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its
credit rating may force it to repay a $ 690 million note next
week . enron said yesterday the terms of the notes , which it
guaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns brazilian
natural - gas assets , are being renegotiated and that it had a
` ` verbal indications ' ' that the maturity of the notes will be
extended .
the company ' s dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements , credit - rating cuts , a federal
investigation and a management shakeup . dynegy plans to complete
its buyout by october , and enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules .
mirant corp . , aquila inc . and other big energy traders are
doing fewer transactions with enron as concerns increase about
its credit rating and ability to finance daily business ,
executives said yesterday .
enron ' s stock fell $ 2 . 28 , or 32 percent , to $ 4 . 71 in
late - morning trading . earlier , it touched $ 4 . 67 , its lowest price
in more than a decade . the shares have plummeted 92 percent this
year . dynegy fell $ 2 . 70 , or 6 . 5 percent , to $ 39 . 00 . the shares
had dropped 26 percent this year .

plunge says end is near at enron
by peter eavis
senior columnist
11 / 21 / 2001 12 : 32 pm est
enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary - research - analysis ) shares plunged a second straight day wednesday as fear mounted that the struggling energy trader ' s bailout merger plan will unravel .
a potentially lethal cash crunch appears to be gripping enron , even though its planned acquirer dynegy ( dyn : nyse - news - commentary - research - analysis ) has injected $ 1 . 5 billion of cash , and banks have opened new credit lines . an enron collapse would cause weeks of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy traders , and it would cause big losses for the houston company ' s creditors .
just before noon est , enron announced in a press release that it had extended to mid - december a $ 690 million obligation that was due next week . it also said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $ 450 million of a previously announced $ 1 billion secured credit line that has j . p . morgan chase as its lead banker .
investors have been fleeing enron since the company last month disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown to unwind some related - party hedging transactions . the securities and exchange commission is probing enron deals with related parties . the october disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested the company hadn ' t been forthcoming about the true state of its finances , and it showed that enron was facing serious liquidity problems .
those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy . but enron ' s disclosure monday that it faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the exits . in the wednesday release , enron ceo ken lay said his company was still committed to the merger : "" we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders , employees and lenders . "" dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is "" continuing our confirmatory due diligence "" regarding the merger . neither enron nor dynegy returned calls seeking comment .
after plunging 23 % tuesday to $ 6 . 99 , enron was down a staggering 34 % at one point wednesday . it moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at $ 4 . 90 . enron shares have lost more than 80 % of their value since the company issued its third - quarter earnings release last month . dynegy dropped $ 2 . 44 , to $ 39 . 26 , though it remains substantially above premerger levels .
at the heart of enron ' s trouble is the sense that the company isn ' t letting on the full extent of its troubles . the selloff in enron shares began in earnest oct . 16 , when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown to unwind some related - party transactions . critics of the company said those deals , in which the company did business with separate entities involving enron managers , raised serious ethical and disclosure issues .
the dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for enron , since as a big trading partner dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of enron ' s situation . as a result , shares in both companies rallied after the deal ' s announcement . but monday ' s disclosure that enron faced $ 690 million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed . according to a merrill lynch report cited in the new york times wednesday , dynegy wasn ' t aware of the $ 690 million obligation . critics of the deal wondered whether enron had told dynegy about all its obligations .
liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a filing of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $ 5 billion of cash in recent weeks . by the end of 2002 , enron has to find around $ 9 billion to pay back various obligations . it had $ 1 . 2 billion in cash on hand as of nov . 16 , according to the filing .
tellingly , dynegy shares haven ' t plunged along with enron , suggesting that investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for enron but not for dynegy . at current levels , enron shares are trading at more than a 50 % discount to the dynegy offer .
j . p . morgan has taken a leading role in helping enron . it has lent funds and it helped restructure the $ 690 million obligation . the bank ' s stock was down 78 cents to $ 38 . 62 . "" we will work with enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy , "" said james lee , a top banker at morgan , in the enron release .

dynegy , enron say merger to proceed
by myra p . saefong
1 : 52 pm et nov 21 , 2001
washington ( cbs . mw ) - - merger partners enron and dynegy restated their
commitment wednesday to completing a deal , on the heels of embattled
enron ' s announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay
off a $ 690 million note set to come due next week .
"" we are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger , ""
said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , in a
statement .
shares of enron ( ene ) recovered slightly in afternoon trading but
remained under pressure .
on heavy volume , the stock - - which had touched $ 4 earlier in the
session - - was down $ 1 . 83 to trade at $ 5 . 16 , a new 10 - year low . some 84
million shares had changed hands .
enron declined 23 percent tuesday after the company revealed the
upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings .
meanwhile , dynegy shares lost $ 1 . 83 to stand at $ 39 . 87 .
enron said that the lead bank on the $ 690 million debt agreed to extend
the maturity date to mid - december , which will give the company time to
restructure the facility , and added it expects to further restructure
its debt .
"" we . . . believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to
enhance our cash position , strengthen our balance sheet , and address
upcoming maturities , "" said jeff mcmahon , chief financial officer , in a
statement .
j . p . morgan chase co . said it and other lenders are committed to
helping enron improve its financial position .
also , enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with dynegy and said
it closed on a previously announced $ 450 million line of credit from
j . p . morgan , collateralized by the company ' s northern natural gas co .
enron - - which is being acquired by its smaller rival dynegy ( dyn ) at a
fire - sale price - - revealed in a securities and exchange commission
filing monday that it had to pay off or refinance $ 690 million in debt
obligations by next monday or risk triggering nearly $ 4 billion in
additional payments .
if enron had missed that deadline and didn ' t post collateral , investors
had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of
enron ' s limited partnerships , the unusual business entities at the
center of the company ' s murky transactions currently under
investigation .
the sec filing of monday also contained yet another restatement of
financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more
than four years of restated earnings figures .
earlier wednesday , goldman sachs lowered its rating on enron ' s stock to
"" market performer "" from its "" u . s . recommended list , "" citing "" major ""
liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the
business it has lost .
cibc world markets also cut enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy . ""
commerzbank weighed in wednesday , saying enron ' s viability is in doubt .
"" we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious
financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt , ""
analysts andre meade and andrew smith wrote . "" it appears that enron ' s
situation could worsen in a number of ways . ""
though enron ' s most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation , meade and smith characterized the information as "" piecemeal . ""
"" it appears that the full extent of enron ' s problems is not currently
known , "" they said in a note , cautioning clients against investing in
enron .",0

re : power play book,"vince ,
you are a saint for lending me a copy of your book . i agree with you that we
don ' t want increase there revenues even by a $ 1 . 00 , although my
recommendation ( and mark palmer ' s as well ) is that we should pursue a
rebuttal for the following reasons :
as i mentioned i scoured the internet ( britannica . com , amazon . com , yahoo . com
and dow jones ) and could not find one mention of the book , therefore mr .
mehta ' s distribution must not be wide at all . consequently , his comments may
not have reached a large audience . issuing a rebuttal , may in fact , draw
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving .
i believe we should proceed with caution , and respond accordingly ( with
counter comments ) only when comments are solicited from us . so far , we have
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to mr . mehta ' s
enron bashing . may be we should ' leave the stones unturned ' .
let me know what you think . also , please contact me when it is convenient
for me to borrow the book from you .

i got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in

i can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important
chapters .
i don ' t think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of
the book .
in general , i think that we should counter the presentations made by mr .

our dhabol operation is a stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an

to speak at the same forum and present the facts as they are . he should be

western issues update 8 / 3 / 01,"aluminum smelters ( dsi ' s )
alcoa aluminum
there are no new developments in the alcoa - bc hydro talks to provide the aluminum producer a source of cheap , stable energy . alcoa is still shopping around to find a good seller , since the load reduction agreement with bpa is still in effect .
it should be noted that bc ' s premier , gordon campbell , has had long - standing poor relations with alcan , inc . of canada , a competitor of alcoa ' s . while in the opposition , campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a $ 1 . 3 b hydroelectric power project . earlier this year , bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy - back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border . if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with , he will likely do so - to that end , look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it .
alcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements . in a recent shareholder meeting last week , alcoa ' s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out , and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re - establishing revenue growth .
kaiser aluminum
with the hiring of harvey perry as the company ' s new aluminum chief , kaiser ' s long - term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear . as the only dsi to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with bpa , they are still in discussions . if anything new arises , we will keep you updated .
bc hydro
bc government
campbell ' s government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration . some of the communities in northern british columbia , such as fort . st . john , dawson creek , black gold and fort mcmurray , have had significant recent population booms , and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region . currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia . significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers , which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska .
bc hydro
hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers . due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power , bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the "" jobs for power "" program , and pursuing lucrative cross - border contracts with us firms . at the same time , hydro will be moving to slice community programs ( anywhere from $ 6 to $ 8 million ) and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the $ 20 - $ 25 million range . bc hydro , whose annual revenues hover typically around $ 300 million , is looking at early mini - budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $ 375 million range . its trading subsidiary , powerex , has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california , and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court .
bc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board , which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell , from campbell ' s transition team . we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate , although we believe he is a vice - president at west coast energy . the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks , so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november . in the meantime , campbell and gary collins ( the finance minister ) will be calling the shots on hydro ' s future . keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines , neufeld , has the official title , but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier - the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda .
bonneville power administration
financial solvency
after having a chance to speak with a source close to sen . patty murray ' s ( d - wa ) office , it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional $ 2 billion in borrowing authority ( over the $ 3 . 75 billion of existing authority it already has ) may be scuttled . sen . murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review - the white house , the senate appropriations committee , omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill . the feeling is that if the $ 2 billion of additional authority would be issued , the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare .
eight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half . the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september , when there is another energy bill conference . obviously , now that bush ' s energy bill has passed the house , they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for anwr drilling .
spill issues
the $ 5 million spill over two columbia river dams a few short weeks after bpa administrator steve wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups .
fish managers , notably critfc ' s bob heinith and odfw ' s christine mallette , had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none , but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year . power operators and the corps of engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill , citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water , making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams , and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pike - minnow .
dam breaching
congressman jim mcdermott ( d - wa ) recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way for breaching the four lower snake dams . it would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the corps of engineers to "" partially remove "" the dams if the secretary of commerce finds it necessary to satisfy esa , clean water act or tribal treaty obligations .
"" the bush administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 salmon recovery plan to avoid dam removal , "" mcdermott said in a july 19 press release . "" if this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously , and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams , then no one would be happier than i would , "" he said . "" now is the time to plan for all contingencies . ""
co - sponsored by tom petri ( r - wi ) and 19 other representatives - - but no others from the northwest - - the bill will have difficulty getting out of committee , where opposition has massed quickly , led by butch otter ( r - id ) and doc hastings ( r - wa ) . the two issued "" dear colleague "" letters asking fellow members not to support mcdermott ' s bill .
pacific northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching . the environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them nowhere to run politically . now that energy prices have come down again , they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation - although they are much weakened now .
forestry issues
forest fires
one of the largest forest fires in the pacific northwest , the thirty mile fire , which claimed the lives of four firefighters , is under control this week . the only other major fire in this region currently is the 4 , 800 - acre union valley fire in southeast washington state . the fire is three and a half miles north of chelan , wa , and evacuations of residences continue in upper union valley and in washington creek drainage . the fire continues to spread north into washington creek drainage . burnout operations on the northeast flank of the fire were successfully completed . we have not seen any reports of this fire disrupting any electrical lines or significantly hampering transmission .",0

the mna covers form commodity and trading agreements entered into between specified dynegy and enron entities . i spoke with sheila tweed ( who did the sithe deal ) about this and we got comfortable that no aspects of the sithe deal were done under the form trading agreements or between the specified entities . in addition , the enron corp . guaranty that will be used in connection with the mna will not supersede the enron corp . guaranty issued in connection with the sithe transaction .

when viewed straight on , the motorola
razr v 3 looks no different from many flip phones . in fact , with its
brushed - silver coloring and rectangular shape , it almost leaves you wondering
exactly what the big deal is . turn the handset on its side , however , and the wow
factor begins . measuring 3 . 8 by 2 . 0 blowing out another ' s candle will not make yours shine brighter . by 0 . 5 inches and weighing 3 . 3 ounces , the
razr v 3 is so pocket - friendly and portable that it ' s smaller than many wallets .
it also feels light - - almost too light - - in the hand , and its distinctive styling
is sure to win looks conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct . ( thomas carlyle ) on the street and in the boardroom . fortunately , motorola
did not compromise a solid construction for the cutting - edge design , and the
burly hinge ensures the phone snaps open and shut with authority . we couldn ' t
help noticing the v 3 is wider and bit taller than many flip phones , but its
paper - thin profile more than makes up for it .
wide load : the razr v 3 isn ' t small in
all ways .
a postage - stamp - size external display
supports 4 , 000 colors and shows the time , battery life , signal strength , and
caller id ( where available ) . though it can be viewed in most lighting
situations , it goes completely dark when the backlighting - - which cannot be
changed - - turns off . above the screen and well out of the way of fingers is the
vga camera lens . you don ' t some books have table of contents ; others have no contents . ( melchor f . cichon ) get a flash or a self - portrait mirror , but the
external screen acts as a viewfinder when the flip is closed . controls on the
outside of the phone are few . a voice - recorder button sits on the right side of
the front flap , while a volume rocker and a dedicated camera key sit on the
left ; when the phone is open , before we set our hearts too much upon anything , let us examine how happy they are who already possess it . ( francois de la rochefoucauld ) the camera button acts as a third soft key . as
they are on the side of the phone , the buttons are rather thin , but we had no
trouble finding them by feel . the secret of happiness is to admire without desire . butcher ' s window : let me meat your needs . beautiful young people are acts of nature , but beautiful old people are works of art . some people drink deeply from the fountain of knowledge , while some others only gargle .
those who do not know how to weep with their whole heart , don ' t know how to laugh either . ( golda meir ) habits lead to character . a banker is someone who lends you an umbrella when the sun is shining , and who asks for it back when it start to rain . no individual raindrop ever considers itself responsible for the flood . some of the world ' s greatest feats were accomplished by people not smart enough to know they were impossible . ( doug larson )
some things that cost $ 5 to buy several years ago now costs $ 10 just to repair . since i have smashed my denominational glasses , i have a better vision of who christ is . the real measure of your wealth is how much you ' d be worth if you lost all your money . ( bernard meltzer )

brad is now working at abacus who works with residential customer patterns as
well as predictive modelling . he ' s going to be here the 25 and 26 of this
month . i ' m not sure who is responsible for resco marketing , but i think they
would find this interesting . who should i send this to ? please let me know
if anybody in resco may have any interest .
thanks ,
steve

subject : re : possible meeting ?
steve :
i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think
it ' ll work .
just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be
interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying
behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,
along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer
response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need
to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe
that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct
marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to
whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other
promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )
because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on
actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than
demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new
entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have
some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many
players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet
utility needs .
i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but
i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to
arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron
might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )
listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .
thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and
hearing how things are going for you .
regards ,
brad davids

refurbs save
cash ! why hesitate getting the best value by getting the
exact same equipment , with original manufacturers warranty at a much
lower price . money back guarantee , if you are not satisfied
- valid for 7 days
only .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb and reduce the
warranty .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
it is
impossible to know the history of each item , but for whatever reason
the unit gets labeled factory refurbished it is inspected
serviced by the manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet
original product specifications . all merchandise is warranted by
the original manufacturer unless otherwise
specified .

tw bullets 2 / 2,"capacity marketing - gas control has determined based on current line pack , temperature , and flows , that tw could deliver another 10 , 000 mmbtu / d on a daily firm basis to the california border . this would put february seasonally adjusted capacity at 1 , 135 , 000 mmbtu / d . marketing has sold the extra capacity for february 2 - 28 to richardson products based on daily index price differentials from permian to cal border .
in addition , bids are due from prospective shippers on friday february 2 for the 400 , 000 mmbtu / d block of east to east capacity with alternate rights to the california border . the alternate west pricing is based on a sharing of the index differential .
transcolorado - tw has been informed by transcolorado ( tc ) that we have been approved to bid on the outsourcing proposal being requested by tc . bids are due february 16 .

re : big cowboy / gepl actuals for february,"please see the attached xcel file . i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy . there are two wells connected to system 429 , which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter 8284 . they are meters 986679 ( currently in trade zone 18 ) and 986742 ( currently in trade zone 1 ) . i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone 21 . this should resolve our volumetric issue .
donna & george ,
please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner .
thank you for your time . please let me know if you have any questions , comments , suggestions .

ect sold 34 , 000 mmbtu to panenergy at meter 4045 for 2 / 99 . i ' ve verified w /
rebekah seales and she has determined that ect did sell this gas to
panenergy . therefore , we need to show a delivery at this meter for panenergy
or whomever panenergy is selling this gas to at this point in pops . i need a
delivery at this meter in order for this meter to balanced .
please take a look at this . call me if you have questions

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

"brandywine meter # : 981225 ; march , 2000 activity","there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

"pastoria backup water contract , mike wood and cole frates","louise ,
this e : mail relates to the fact that the two azurix people helped us out on getting the water deal done although the azurix agreement will be terminated and azurix will not receive any income associated with the ultimate water agreement that was put in place . originally they were looking at some success fees and origination totalling up to $ 3 . 1 mm , but because the purchase price adjustment due to the water agreement cost ena $ 5 mm , they are appropriately getting nothing .

subject : pastoria backup water contract , mike wood and cole frates
last friday ena executed an agreement to sell the pastoria power plant project to calpine , which we should close in the very near future . i am writing this memo to personally indicate that we could not have done that , especially when we did , without the assistance of mike wood and cole frates .
there has been conversation around ena that : "" . . . had azurix gotten the backup water deal done last year as per their contract , we would have been able to close with calpine then . "" that may be true . but we all have had deals that have not gone the way we planned , good effort notwithstanding . after working with mike and cole on this deal , i can personally attest to the extreme difficulty they had in dealing with their counterparty for that backup contract .
i want to give special credit to mike and cole for their professional and tenacious behavior these last couple of months . notwithstanding the turmoil at azurix and calpine ' s stated desire to terminate their contract as a condition of closing ( and keep just the backup contract ) , mike and cole kept their eye on the ball . and that ball was : "" what is best for enron . "" they continued to provide detailed , expert insight to the issues . they continued to interface with the counterparty . they attended every meeting . they were there until we got the backup water deal done .
i am proud to have worked with them . all of the members of my team on this deal have exactly the same thing to say about these two guys .",0

signals , and ( c ) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes
syndication of the investment , if applicable , and a specific exit strategy .
portfolio management includes restructuring / special assets ( randy

business intent,"dear sir ,
i am stanley woodwork , the secetary of africa white farmers
co - operation ( awfc ) of zimbabwe . after the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president mr . robert mugabe won the presidential election , the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme . this programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white african farmers for redistribution to black africans . this programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including british prime minister , mr tony blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
victimization and physical abuse .
two weeks ago , our headquartes in harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building . fortunately , they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
belong to the co - operation . this cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government .
now i have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe . the cash in question is us $ 46 million dollars .
once i can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then i would proceed to get the funds freighted to europe , where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us .
you do not have anything to worry about as i would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe , and the business proposal is 100 % legal and risk free .
you would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe .
please get back to me if you can be of assistance and i would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government .
i expect 100 % confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed . you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork @ email . com
kind regards ,
stanley woodwork .",1

merchant platforms for buying and selling energy to match assets to
customer loads ; and ( 3 ) solution sites for serving wholesale customers .
this boom in online energy trading has provided a golden opportunity
for bangalore - based orbit - e , a consultancy start - up promoted last year
by mr . rahul chawla , former ceo of the indian arm of cambridge
technology partners . orbit - e was initially set up to provide consultancy
and devising solutions for trading in financial securities . mr . chawla
believed that the experience of orbit - e in working with dealers in
financial securities could be leveraged to working with energy
traders . to boost its standing in the energy trading area , orbit - e has
taken on as a managing partner , mr . j . kevin mcconville , who was
managing director of enron north america between 1998 and 2000 . enron ,
according to the forrester report , redefined online energy trading in
2000 , accounting for $ 336 million of the total $ 400 million value
traded . by the end of the year , enron ' s marketmakers conducted 74 per
cent of their trades through enrononline , rather than closing deals over
the phone .
orbit - e , which has now around 90 persons on board , secured its first
round of venture funding from warburg pincus in october last year .
pointing out that the financing came at a time when venture funds were
fighting shy of the it industry , mr . chawla claimed that this was an
indication of the sound prospects for the company due to the niche areas
it had selected .
at a time when toplines in this industry are contracting , orbit - e
expects to cross a turnover of rs . 20 crores in the current year , up
from rs . 8 crores last year .

sunday news,"hi sally ,
i need to be working on my newest project , for which we went to hallettsville

re : fw : hanover,"gkh ' s drag - alone rights only extend to stock actually owned by jedi ( or a subsequent purchaser in a "" non exempt "" transaction ) . to the extent we have disposed of a part of our interest in a public sale ( an exempt transaction ) the rights do not attach to the shares themselves .
if jedi sells to a third party in a non - public transaction ( a "" non exempt "" transaction ) this stock would be subject to the drag along , tag along conditions and the other provisions of the stockholders agreement . there are other restrictions that restrict partial sales in a non exempt transaction to less that 50 % of the original share ownership .
enron has valued the hanover investment at the screen price for mark to market accounting based upon the free disposition in a public transaction . there is no question that any restriction on private sales theoretically impacts value negatively . on the other hand , the "" tag along "" rights theoretically have a positive impact on value .
in your example , if gkh sells to xyz subsequent to completion of enron ' s sale to abc , in that case gkh could require abc to sell to xyz at $ 20 . on the other hand if gkh cuts a deal to sell to xyz at $ 60 , abc would have tag along rights of inclusion at $ 60 .

sales under a 33 act registration and rule 144 are "" exempt transactions "" per the jedi / gkh / hanover stockholders agreement . several months ago i confirmed with ray bowen that there are no other agreements that would restrict our dispositions via a public sale .
prior to actually starting a 144 process i would advise both gkh and hanover of our plans .

dan , although it seems that the secondary offering lockup requirements rule out
the type of transaction discussed this morning , the issue of other restrictions
on jedi right to sell was introduced .
gkh has drag - along and jedi has tag - along rights .
there is an agreement among the company , gkh and jedi that restricts but does
not preclude disposition :
transfers to affiliates are ok
a registered offering or rule 144 disposition are ok
other sales involve a rofr :
written notice to company 30 days prior to proposed disposition to bona fide
purchaser
company has 20 days to respond to buy all or a portion of proposed
disposition on same terms and conditions
if company does not take all shares , any remaining offered to other
shareholder within 2 days
the other shareholder has 7 days to respond
these are the primary provisions . we would need a more detailed assessment of
the issue once a specific structure proposed / accepted .
let me know if i can help .

vehicle accidents - alert,"as you know , safety is the top priority for ets . therefore , when we see incident levels rising in any area involving our employees , company property , the public , or public property , it receives an immediate focus and plan of action . this is the case with the increasing number of vehicle accidents occurring across the ets operating system .
here are the facts
? to date , there have been 35 vehicle accidents experienced during 2001 ; this number has more than doubled the number reported for the entire year 2000 .
? seventeen of the 35 vehicle accidents this year involved employees backing up and could have been prevented .
?
? seven of these 35 vehicle accidents involved an employee striking a fixed object , each of which also could have been prevented .
?
? this means that 68 % of the vehicle accidents this year have been preventable . driver awareness training and continued communications have not had a profound effect on decreasing the number of preventable accidents .
?
? action plan
?
? in an effort to decrease the number of preventable accidents , effective immediately :
?
? all vehicle operators are required to use the "" backing - in "" policy when parking , and conduct a "" safety circle walk "" when leaving a parking space . the only exception would be when "" backing - in "" causes a greater safety concern . each operations team is accountable to see that every team member meets these two requirements .
?
? each employee involved in a preventable vehicle accident will be required to personally review the details of the accident with the operation ' s regional director and provide an overview of safe driving techniques at the next team safety meeting .
?
? common based objectives for all ets personnel are being immediately adjusted to include a "" safe driving "" component . preventable accidents may impact the team ' s performance evaluation and could result in disciplinary action being enforced on the team and / or individual employee .
this action plan is designed to eliminate the rising number of motor vehicle collisions . it is not put into place to create a burden on anyone , but rather to ensure that all work is performed safely .
please join me in getting behind this initiative to raise awareness that the safe operation of every vehicle is required and that each employee is responsible for his or her decisions when behind the wheel .

subject : extension of petro - canada wholesale gas services arrangement for 5 more years
on wednesday the president of petro - canada approved the extension of our wholesale gas services agreement after the first term expires november 1 , 2002 , for an incremental 5 years . this has taken me a a while to get closed ( and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service ) , but keep in mind it ' s not easy to renew something half way through the first term .
this extension is very significant for the following reasons :
1 . it creates a mtm income of $ 2 . 9 mm cdn , net of directly attributable costs to provide the back - office services ;
2 . it supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income ( along with all the production information etc . ) ;
3 . of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across canada . as you know , we have used the petro - canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide , not only when marketing in canada but also in the us and europe . now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years , but they ' ve liked it so much they ' ve already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service .
obviously this is a great credit to our commercial staff and the operations , accounting and it staff that work with petro - canada . i will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them . it takes alot of effort to "" enchant "" the customer day after day , year after year . in fact it ' s incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider .
the numbers :
under the extension , we have provided petro - canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee .
original base fee is $ 1 . 75 mm cdn per year , payable monthly .
rebate offered :
jan / 01 - nov / 01 ( $ 458 , 300 ) cdn
nov / 01 - nov / 02 ( $ 517 , 000 ) cdn
fee charged for extension term :
nov / 02 - nov / 03 $ 1 , 366 , 000 cdn
nov / 03 - nov / 04 $ 1 , 400 , 000 cdn
nov / 04 - nov / 05 $ 1 , 435 , 000 cdn
nov / 05 - nov / 06 $ 1 , 470 , 000 cdn
nov / 06 - nov / 07 $ 1 , 510 , 000 cdn
we have thoroughly defined our back - office costs required to provide these services at $ 428 , 700 cdn / yr ( 2000 $ ) , and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection ( with escalation at 2 % per year ) for the second five year term . these costs include back - office staff allocations ( salaries and benefits ) , and rent / infrastructure allocation . we have checked on the allocation of houston costs , and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels . we do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow .
in discussions with wes , this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope , will allow us to mtm this income . the mtm income of $ 2 . 9 mm cdn includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term , and has been reduced by the above annual costs .
notes :
1 . we have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with pcog on what our benchmark should be , given that much of the intermediate producers in the group of 40 have disappeared . we will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to .
2 . if petro - canada ' s sales volumes fall to 60 % of last years levels , there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate . we also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140 % of today ' s levels . petro - canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected . volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7 - 8 % year on year .
3 . peter and i should have the amended agreement out next week .",0

dearly beloved in christ,"dearly beloved in christ ,
please send all emails to : project 4 dneedy @ yahoo . co . in
it is by the grace of god that i received christ , having known the
truth , i had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the
sight
of god for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of god  s
mercy and glory upon my life .
i am mrs melissa pointer the wife of mr harry pointer , my husband
worked with the chevron / texaco in kenya for twenty years before he
died
in the year 2001 . we were married for ten years without a child .
my husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days .
before his death we were both born again christians .
since his death i decided not to re - marry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the bible is against . when my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of us $ 3 . 5 m . ( three million five hundred
thousand u . s . dollars ) with a bank in europe .
presently , this money is still with the bank and the management just
wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of
this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to
receive it on my behalf if i can not come over .
presently , i ' m in a hospital in kenya where i have been undergoing
treatment for esophageal cancer . i have since lost my ability to talk
and my doctors have told me that i have only a few weeks to live . it
is
my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations
any
where in the world .
because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth
since
my illness , i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge
responsibility to any of them . please , i beg you in the name of god to
help me stand and collect the funds from the bank .
i want a person that is god fearing that will use this money to fund
churches , orphanages and widows propagating the word of god and to
ensure that the house of god is maintained .
the bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth .
i took this decision because i don ' t have any child that will inherit
this money and my husband relatives are not christians and i don ' t
want
my husband ' s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers . i don ' t
want
a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner .
hence the reason for taking this bold decision . i am not afraid of
death hence i know where i am going . i know that i am going to be in
the bosom of the lord .
exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold
my peace . i don ' t need any telephone communication in this regard
because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband ' s relatives
around me always . i don ' t want them to know about this development .
with
god all things are possible .
as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of
attorney who is in europe as he will be the one to assist you in
laying
claims for this funds .

subject : enron stock options of hpl employees
gentlemen :
attached below are copies of some correspondence between fran mays and me regarding the time period allowed to exercise stock options after my involuntary termination from enron due to the sale of houston pipe line to aep .
apparently various stock option plans allow different time periods for exercise in such cases - - the norm seems to be three years . however , employees who were able to participate in the original "" all - employee "" stock option plan at its inception were allowed a period of only one year . it seems that employees who joined enron in years following the inception of this plan were able to participate to a limited degree , but were allowed a three - year period in the case of involuntary termination .
following are the facts material to this issue :
1 . fran mays was represented to hpl employees as the authoritative source of information regarding enron benefits available to employees who would be terminated due to the sale of hpl .
2 . even though documentation of the various benefit plans exist , the documentation may not be clear in some cases and subject to interpretation by an authoritative enron source . it is always prudent for an employee to have an official company interpretation of any plan document rather than to rely on their own interpretation .
3 . in an instance of a divestiture , merger , or other change of control of a company , in my personal experience , there can be , and often are , modifications and exceptions to benefit plans . usually this is done in the interest of fairness to employees affected . in my own case in the sale of hpl , there was an exception made since i did not retire from enron , but for vesting of stock options was considered to have retired . this allowed me to be vested in some stock options that i would have lost . the monetary benefit of this exception was not significant since i only had about 25 unvested share options , but it is a precedent .
4 . i submitted to fran mays , through my supervisor , a question that specifically addressed the stock option exercise period .
5 . the only response to the specific written question that i submitted was contained in a general q & a format response from fran mays which contains an unequivocal , direct statement that the period to exercise vested options after involuntary termination due to the sale of hpl is three years .
6 . there was a disclaimer in the q & a document that referenced plan documents . a disclaimer of this sort may be useful to address details of some specific issue or to allow clarification due to some ambiguity , but a disclaimer cannot negate and reverse a direct , clear , unequivocal statement of fact . there is logic that allows the application of the disclaimer to a statement of fact .
i , among a number of hpl employees who are former enron employees , made significant personal decisions based on reliance on the statement in the q & a that we had three years to exercise all options . the one year period currently being allowed can impact both exercise price and income tax consequences . although i recognize that the actual impact depends on personal decisions of when to exercise options , in my case the combined impact could be very significant .
from aep ' s perspective , enron employees who agreed to stay with hpl and move to aep with the sale added a great deal of value to the hpl acquisition . it seems only reasonable to treat these former employees with a sense of fairness and not to penalize them for a career decision that benefited enron .
i am requesting that the time to exercise the original all - employee options be extended to three years . this would make this stock option plan consistent with other enron stock option plans and would settle the ongoing issue of the representation to hpl employees that the period would be three years . this change would allow hpl employees who acted as loyal enron employees and made a significant career choice that benefitted enron to feel that they were treated fairly by enron .

subject : re : stock option questions
your position that the general disclaimer on the q & a of march 8
negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to
exercise stock options is unacceptable . if the answer to this
specific question , shown below , was that various plans had various
periods for exercise , then that should have been the answer to the
question , not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is
three years . i , and i am sure many others , made certain critical
decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no
validity . i would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to
allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years
unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant .
i use the term "" expiration date "" to be the normal expiration date that
would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone
continuing employment with enron .
with regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the
particular stock option plan and cannot be changed , anything can be
changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a
transition due to a merger , spin off or sale of a company . special
provisions were made to exclude hpl employees from the new all
employee stock option plan , special provisions were made to provide a
5 % payment to hpl employees in lieu of the new stock option plan ,
special provisions were made to consider hpl employees over the age of
55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting
of stock options and i feel sure that there have been other special
considerations to certain employees .
lal echterhoff
from march 8 , 2001 , q & a :
"" 1 . with the transfer to aep , will my termination be listed as
involuntary so that i can exercise my vested options ?
yes , your transfer to aep will be treated as an involuntary
termination by reason of divestiture from enron .
2 . what is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options ?
the period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination ,

subject : stock option questions
we have received questions from many employees concerning the
expiration date for stock options . the q & a dated march 8 , 2001 stated
three years as the exercise date for options . however , on page 1 of
the document , a statement was included regarding the intent of the
document and that the stock
option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock
option program .
if you have options listed on the stock option termination report
which list a one year expiration , not three years as stated in
question # 16 of the document , this is correct and follows the
provision of the plan document . some employees have options granted
under a different stock option plan and that plan carries
a three year term of expiration . please review your report
carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under .
additionally , the document was intended to provide general
information only . page 1 included the statement regarding the plan
document specifically in case
there were any errors made in the document . additionally , we
stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for
their review . enron provides
the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves
with the plan and make decisions based on plan document .
i apologize for any confusion this may have caused , however , the
plan under which the options were granted is the official document by
which enron determines
the termination date . please call me if you need to discuss your
options , however , understand that i cannot speak with you regarding
other employees ' compensation / options .",0

i am flying to houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming tuesday sometime for 1 / 2 hour or
so . i really want to reinitiate the conversations marketpoint was having
with john goodpasture and you , and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift . john was quite
positive about the idea of enron acquiring marketpoint narg through license ,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you .
would this coming tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys ? if
so , please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 . i think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run narg
and the long run narg in which you were interested ( not to mention our power
model ) . the progress is noticeable since you saw it . both long and short
term narg are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from venezuelan lng , north american lng import terminals and
term , gas basis calculations , trading support , power plant development ,
gas - to - power price spreads in key markets , veracity of heat rate trades ,
bank financings , storage field evaluation , and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs .
i really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again . i think narg can help you become even more
successful , and i look forward to working with you .

summary
gov . davis is expected to announce a plan today , however , there have been no breakthrough deals in negotiations that would support a plan .
sources report that at least 7 or 8 democrats have indicated to consumer advocate harvey rosenfield that they would join republicans in blocking any proposed bailout by governor davis . this coalition would be enough to kill any transmission purchase proposal .
the emergency legislative session is closed , after which all current legislation would need to be introduced in a new session .
1 . bankruptcy outlook
an advisor to mbia * is attempting to pull other creditors into an informal pre - petition committee . however , the creditors are finding that their interests are not always the same , and inter - creditor politics are becoming very active at this point . for instance :
- bc hydro is not inclined to take aggressive action , even though they are one of the biggest creditors . as their power is hydro , they are operating with a huge margin - i . e . , they do not owe any other companies for gas used to produce their power .
- reliant , using the "" squeaky wheel "" theory , took a hard line with the governor and succeeded in extracting a partial payment from dwr in exchange for a 30 - day agreement to supply power . other creditors have seen this and are thinking along similar lines .
- the generators and qfs as a whole are not very organized yet . the qfs are negotiating with the state on reducing the amount they are prepared to get paid for the power they supply , but the negotiations reportedly are not going well , and there is no deal in sight . reportedly the state has offered to pay the qfs $ . 07 / kwh , but the qfs want $ . 09 / kwh .
* mbia is a credit insurer . in other words , if a company issues revenue bonds , mbia , for a fee , will reimburse the bondholders for their losses up to a certain level ( e . g . the first 10 - 15 % ) . i believe it at one time stood for municipal bond insurers ' association . they have a aaa rating .
2 . legislative activity
once the extraordinary session is closed by the governor it ends and all bills in that session are dead . they would have to be reintroduced with new bill numbers and run through the process again . if the bills have already been heard once in committee it is probable these bills will be taken up for a vote . the legislator is having so many hearings on bills this week to try and get as many through before the extraordinary session ends .",0

hi don ,
the investment climate out there is very harsh , as you probably know . for me to raise vc money i need to show client business .
if you could confirm to me on a non - binding basis that enron americas is looking to continue to use dealbench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached , that would help me a great deal in the process . please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate .
please reply to my enron e - mail as well as my private e - mail

thanks very much and i will be in touch ( after the quarter and your successful divestitures : - )

fw : make money fast and legal ! as seen on tv ! 65000 $ +,"the ultimate way to work from home
the best money making system of all ! !
as seen on national tv
as seen on 20 / 20 and many other credible references . this is not a scam .
i hope this is ok that i send you this . if you aren ' t interested , just
simply delete it .
read this message if you are like me and want more than your lousy
weekly paycheck . make more in a few months than last year at work .
believe it , work it .
this really works , don ' t make the same mistake i made . i deleted this
4 - 5 times before finally giving it a try . within 2 weeks the orders
( money )
started coming in just like the plan below said it would . give it a
try ! !
you will be glad you did .
thanks and good luck ! you won ' t need luck , just keep reading . don ' t
delete this ! ! !
first read about how a 15 year old made $ 71 , 000 . see below . . . .
as seen on national tv : this is the media report .
parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden
in his closet !
does this headline look familiar ? of course it does .
you most likely have just seen this story recently
featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .
and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck
of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning
and putting laundry away when she came across a large
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her
15 - year - old sons closet .
nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash .
five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds -
all neatly rubber - banded in labeled piles .
"" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" ,
says the 41 - year - old woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000
dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband
earns in a year "" .
the woman immediately called her husband at the
car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she
had discovered . he came home right away and they
drove together to the boys school and picked him up .
little did they suspect that where the money came from
was more shocking than actually finding it in
the closet .
as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via
e - mail , a type of "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he
obtained off the internet . everyday after school for
the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom .
"" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the
heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said
and i started sending it out "" , says the clever
15 - year - old .
the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained
instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person
on the list , then delete the address at the top and
move the others addresses down , and finally to add
your name to the top of the list .
the letter goes on to state that you would receive
several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2
weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk
e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was
going to work "" , the boy continues .
within the first few days of sending out the e - mail ,
the post office box that his parents had gotten him
for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to
fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing
$ 5 bills .
"" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300
envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip
that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter .
i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he
goes on , "" i went up to the counter and they had a
whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because i could not
carry it all "" .
over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending
out the e - mail . "" the money just kept coming in and i
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet ,
barely had time for my homework "" . he had also
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his
area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties
and hundreds .
"" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a
time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me .
one time the lady gave me a really strange look and
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and
my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just
rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . ""
surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be
afraid . the reporting news team examined and
investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter
at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to
us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and
1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also
in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 ,
sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service
must be exchanged for money received .
every five - dollar bill that he received contained a
little note that read , "" please send me report number
xyx "" . this simple note made the letter legal because he
was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a
five - dollar fee .
[ this is the end of the media release . if you would
like to understand how the system works and get your
$ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what appears below
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
you can use it too - just follow the simple
instructions ] .
thanks to the computer age and the internet !
you will make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your
home ! !
before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the
popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news
program
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program
described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show
also
investigated whether or not the program was legal .
their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no
laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can - follow
the simple instructions , they are bound to make some mega bucks with only
$ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' .
due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this
program has
attained , it is currently working better than ever .
this is what one had to say : ' ' thanks to this profitable opportunity .
i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so
glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for
the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received
total
$ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in ' ' .
pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .
= = = = = = = here is
another testimonial : ' ' ' this program has been around for a
long time but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this
again in the mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the
simple instructions and wallaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to
come
in . first month i only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that
made a total of $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering
the
program , i have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change
anything . ' ' more testimonials later but first :

if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily
and comfortably , please read the following . . . then read it again and
again ! ! !
$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
follow the simple instruction below and your financial
dreams will come
true , guaranteed !
instructions :
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report
you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose
name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return
address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail
problems .
= = = when you place your order , make sure you order each of the 5
reports .
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer
and resell them . your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .
within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports
from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will
be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them
from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk
in case something happens to your computer .
important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other
than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1 through 6 ' ' or you will
loose out on majority of your profits . once you understand the way this
works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember ,
this
method has been tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! ! ! people
have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they
could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , we all
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change
anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not
work for you .
remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !
1 . . . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement
and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 .
this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune .
2 . . . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .
3 . . . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .
4 . . . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .
5 . . . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2
6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .
please make sure you copy every name & address accurately !
= = = = = = =
* * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it
on your computer . do not make any other changes .
save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data . to assist
you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which
includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of
free
classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going :
method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally
= = = = = = =
let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and
we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each .
let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the
response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many
people will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000
each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails .
with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1
those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total
of 50 , 000 .
out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100
people responded and ordered report # 2 .
those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000
e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .
those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5
million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders
for report ! # 4 . whose 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a
total of
50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000
orders for
report # 5 that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half
million ) .
your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500
+ 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . . grand
total = $ 555 , 550 . 00
numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the
worst possibleresponses and no matter how you
calculate it , you will still
make a lot of money !
= = = = = = =
remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering
out
of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if
everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails
each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !
method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet
= = = = = = =
advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are
hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the
internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you
start with method # land add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you
receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s
it . always provide
same day service on all orders .
this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your
name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise
until they receive the report .
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = available reports
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
order each report by its number & name only . notes : always
send
$ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on
one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you
are ordering ,
your e - mail address and your name and postal address .

brad romine,"celeste ,
i was under the impression i sent you a message regarding brad romine but
i cannot find a copy in my msg folder . there might have been a glitch in the
cc - mail
and the message did not go through and wasn ' t stored .
i wanted to make the following points :
1 . brad will not show up on march 15 . he is still working on his dot - com
business and wants to
pursue this opportunity .
2 . my recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand . either brad
or a stipend
refund check should show up on march 15 .
3 . i told brad that a failure to show up on march 15 will not imperil his
future employment opportunities
with enron . we just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource
needs . if he decides to re - apply
at some point in the future , we shall not hold his decision to pursue him
entrepreneurial plans against him .
please , let me know what you think .

fw : credit watch list - - week of 9 / 17 / 01,"louise ,
i think that john ( see below ) raises a valid point regarding our credit dismissal of the airline industry . enron does a very good job "" wooing "" a sector doing good times , but as soon as the commercial operations get tough we dump like a hot potato . as such , when we will try to entertain the airline sector in the future to do risk management and hedging through enron , substantial ill will this from prior disposal will have been created . do we care ?
i have got to think that there should exist sufficient origination opportunities for companies going into bankruptcy - - maybe for lydecker ' s organization ?

hill stimulus bill update : 10 / 16 / 01,"us treasury sec ' y o ' neill has been out in front this week as an administration voice trying to shape the parameters of the hill debates ( trying to keep the lid on some proposals that could have long - term costs for the budgets several years out ) . it will continue to be a delicate balance , as the administration is looking to get a final bill by the end of next week and get money into pockets in time for the end of the year .
fed chair greenspan could also critically affect the debate tomorrow in testimony before the joint economic committee : his core belief is that whatever the precise stimulus number arrived at , it should be primarily temporary in character . his preference under current conditions is for security and fiscal policy to be the response instruments in the face of the diminishing returns to and efficacy of further rate reductions in the face of uncertainty .
competitive analysis will continue to follow this issue closely and welcomes feedback and further specific questions on the issues below . please contact brendan fitzsimmons at x 5 - 4763 with further questions .

competitive analysis
hill stimulus bill update : 10 / 16 / 01
partisanship is the question for senate battle : final stimulus bill likely in the $ 80 - 110 b range , but hill dems ' and repubs ' aims could push it northward
summary
senate numbers look set to exceed bush figures ( $ 60 - 75 b ) , may approach house ways and means $ 100 b ; final conferenced bill could hit $ 140 b ; all on this on top of the special $ 55 b approved right after the attacks for airlines and immediate impact areas
republican plan , so far , all tax cuts and no spending
democratic plan has a lot more spending , but it is all on supporting people who have lost their jobs and none of it is on infrastructure
final , conferenced bill may run as high as $ 140 b if the ' neglected ' middle - class is given another rebate check ( up to another $ 38 b )
one major question hanging over size , composition and speed of the senate package is whether senate maj . leader daschle decides to move quickly toward a bipartisan senate package that tries to isolate the house republicans and their business tax cutting agenda
daschle will present dilemma to president bush and his senior advisers . "" we will tell the president that we need assurance from the white house that compromises we make will be supported by the white house . if bush can ' t give that assurance - unable to control the right - then we will probably opt for the more partisan position . ""
report
the centrifugal pull of a big number like $ 100 b proved the main attractor in early action on the stimulus front . house ways and means committee votes approved a tax cut package - mainly for businesses - that added up to just about exactly that number . the senate will produce something a little smaller , but the handwriting is on the wall as the two houses of congress move toward a conference committee package that could easily top that total .
one key member of the senate negotiations told sources late sunday : "" we are working on a package designed to stay with the principle that everything should be temporary and roll off after one year to avoid blowing through budget surpluses later . right now we are still aiming to stay in bush ' s $ 60 b to $ 75 b bracket , but everyone knows the final number will go up from there . ""
although senate process is controlled by democrats , senate finance committee chairman baucus ( dem ) is in a highly contested re - election campaign next year in a deeply republican state . just as he did with the earlier bush tax cut plan , you can expect him to reach out to work with senior republicans ( such as grassley ) despite the wishes of more partisan members of the leadership .
likely elements of the democratic senate package :
rebates for those who pay payroll taxes but did not get the first $ 300 or $ 600 rebate . this was also in the house republican package .
temporary investment incentive for businesses - this could easily be 30 % - but they will keep it to one year .
some form of extending the loss - carryback for businesses and allowing one - year use of amt credits in 2002 . the loss - carryback is quite likely because of the relatively small 10 - year costs . for democrats amt is more complicated . ( see below )
some form of expanded unemployment insurance incentive - not just extending the number of weeks , but other elements to expand who is eligible .
50 % rebate for unemployed workers who pay for extended health care benefits through the cobra program .
partisanship question :
there are a series of senior democrats who argue that an early compromise could be a major mistake since house republicans will simply "" pocket the concessions we make toward republican - style tax cutting and press on with their business tax cutting agenda during the conference committee . "" in other words , does daschle position the senate democrats for the bipartisan high road after this bill is passed or does he position democrats for the partisan wrangling that seems very likely all the way to conference committee later this month .
looking forward to the final , conferenced bill :
sorting through various proposals , sources suggest a possible solution agenda :
rebate for bottom 34 million payroll taxpayers
30 % expensing for 12 months ( maybe compromise of 18 months )
five year net - loss carry back unemployment insurance extension and some expansion - - maybe through help directly to states ( more rep . governors may like that ) and some cobra assistance .
repeal of corporate amt ( or several - year suspension ) as concessions to house republicans ( dems go along but say it will be a big mistake )
odds and ends from appropriators ( energy assistance , food assistance , etc )
all of this comes to around $ 100 billion . although the numbers have gravitated steadily northward , there is one major decision to be made that could add another $ 40 billion to the total ( bringing the final stimulus package to something like $ 120 - $ 140 b ) : more rebate checks
both house and senate agree there should be a rebate for those workers who did not get the earlier rebate because they did not earn enough to pay income taxes ( that ' s the bottom 34 million ) . but it would be highly unlike this - or any - congress to pass stimulus legislation that helped the bottom 20 % and the top 2 % ( through major business tax cuts ) , but left the 75 % in the middle out of the equation entirely . one solution could be to send another rebate to everyone : another $ 38 b",0

merchanting metals update,"several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating
risk for the merchanting metals business .
complexities surrounding the operation of the off balance sheet facility
( "" obsf "" ) which commenced two weeks before the year end .
the uncertainty generated by the revocation of aa ' s signoff for the facility
late in the year end audit .
the discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the as 400 merchanting code ,
arising from the release of obsf designed functionality , which compounded the
operational burden of supporting the obsf .
the requirement to amend the operational process and obsf it code as a result
of the current renegotiation of the obsf with barclays ( and aa ) .
the senior it developer for merchanting has resigned and been sent on
gardening leave .
the corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the merchanting
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as
to the accuracy of the ql dpr and business balance sheet .
the implementation for sap for the merchanting business has been delayed and
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) brokerage
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on obsf for it merchanting
developers .
the ar / ap sap data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as
to provide a detailed analysis as at end ql .
middle office have instigated a new daily working capital report process
tracking cash settlement / funding data to working capital components for all
metals businesses .
an enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end ql
covering gross tonnage , spread positions and summarised analyses for brand
and locations . the necessary report functionality should be available within
the as 400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical
vba / excel reports outside of the as 400 but using as 400 data downloads .
user requests for additional as 400 functionality and reports have been
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of
ql following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements
for the support of obsf .
a resubstantiation of the full ql dpr will be completed by the risk control
staff reconciling the full trial balances between ql open and ql close
a full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the ql audit
timetable which incorporates
a full circularisation of inventory balances , and matching to source
documentation within enron
inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party
inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will
not be received on a timely basis
substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report
signed off by the traders )
full reconciliation and recalculation of obsf option premium values
full reconciliation of contracts within the obsf to barclays documentation (
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase )
and to as 400 barclays account
a risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation , where
applicable , and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
a full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or
external documentation ( invoices / request for payment )
a full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
a full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts
i intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during
april

welcome,"network world fusion focus : jason meserve on
security and bug patch alert
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
03 / 06 / 00
dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
by jason meserve
welcome to the security and bug patch alert newsletter !
given the recent spate of high - profile denial - of - service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published , it is
clear that security is a major concern in the it community as it
should be .
with technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center , it departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running as well as secure . no chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the ceo that their e - commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied . stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer  , s mind more than an expensive
super bowl ad .
it  , s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies , never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e - commerce
application . but we  , re here to help .
once a week we  , ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source . we  , ll
also provide other ( hopefully ) useful resources for the security -
conscious it manager .
comments and suggestions are always welcome ! send mail to
jmeserve @ nww . com .
now on with the latest patches and alerts :
security glitch hits foundry switches

subject : pge park suite talk - first right of refusal
one of the benefits of our suite at pge park is that we have the first right of refusal on non - portland family entertainment events such as psu football games and the city jazzfest concert . ena will periodically receive notices of such events so as to determine our level of interest in purchasing the tickets before they are available to the general public . non - portland family entertainment ticket purchase opportunities are for enron employees , and the tickets may not be resold to outside parties .
if you are interested in purchasing tickets for either the psu football games or city jazzfest , please notify me via e - mail by 2 pm pacific time , friday , june 8 . these tickets are to be purchased by the employee . the entire suite must be purchased by enron employees in order for us to obtain the tickets . twenty - two tickets per event are available : 18 are seats and stools , 4 are standing room .
? the price for city jazzfest ( sunday , july 15 ) is $ 916 for 22 tickets = about $ 42 per ticket .
? the price for all 6 psu vikings games ( 22 tickets each ) is $ 1 , 404 : about $ 11 per game , per person , and all 6 games must be purchased .
we will proceed with ticket purchase and distribution after you establish your commitment .
please let me know if you have any questions .
best regards ,

dear vincent ,
as i told you on the phone on friday , i am very interested in a summer
internship at enron . i would like to point out that i want to pursue a
career in trading , and i am especially interested in derivatives . given that
enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy , broadband and weather
derivatives , i find it a company i would be most interested in working for .
i believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm , and i
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours . i have
final exams from march 19 - 22 , but would be most willing to travel to houston
for interviews any time from friday march 23 rd onwards . i hope to hear from
you soon .

in good faith,"reply : phillipwilliams @ tangana . com
as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my
name is phillip williams , a merchant in u . k . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has
defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to
medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even
myself ) but my business .
though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my
business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a
second chance to come to this world , i would live my
life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of
my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i
want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so i have decided to give also to charity
organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good
deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria
and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once
asked members of my family to close one my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to
charity organizations in asia and u . k , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not
trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my
money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty five million dollars $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 that
i have with a finance institution in europe . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and
dispatche it to charity organizations . i have set aside 20 % for you and some expences that may incure
during the proccess of these transaction . god be with you . please reach me through my personal email
address of : phillipwilliams @ tangana . com remember to keep this known to yourse lf alone and i for
now , as i am doing this as a contribution to life on earth . i will also appreciate if you provide me with your
contact mobile and home phone numbers , so that i can forward them to a reputable lawyer who would put
you through the whole process . i
will really appreciate your quick response .
stay blessed ,

i agree with what you say - my view is that research can :
- assess a model ;
- state what the model does ;
- give a view of how closely the model achieves its objectives ;
- assess what the risks of using the model are .
it is for rac to determine whether enron is prepared to accept this risk . i
discussed this issue with ted , and he seems to agree with this broad
splitting of responsibilities .

steve ,
i understand your comments but the ' sign off ' is a cross functional thing and
research are effectively only being asked to sign off their part which is
broadly as you describe below . if you have doubts as to the interpretation of
a research sign off then it should be qualified to state what you are
prepared to sign off on . other functions should be asked to do like wise for
their area which will mean that when all areas have signed off their part
the picture is complete . somebody needs to coordinate this and usually in
london it is the risk management guy .
does this make sense ?

subject : research sign off
hi sharad
i note from our discussion earlier this morning that you ' ve been asked to
sign off a calculation from another group , which is something we ' re asked to
do from time to time .
i take the view that we in research can assess a computation in terms of what
it achieves with respect to its requirements , what its shortfalls are , and
therefore what the risks associated with using this method are . we cannot
provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to enron , which i
feel falls firmly within rac territory .
this then raises the question of can research sign off anything for other
groups after all ? to "" sign off "" means to accept something , which our opinion
in itself cannot do . it is most appropriate for us to provide a technical
note outlining the methodology , risks and shortcomings of a method , leaving
the formal "" sign off "" to those best placed to assess these risks for our
company . the alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view
on what is acceptable risk for the company .

louise ,
1 ) i just received a call from pat o ' donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from ubs corporate marketing folks , instructing us not to use the url : www . ubswenergy . com . it seems they want us to use www . ubswarburg . com / energy . pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy . com tomorrow . he anticipates having resolution by noon . i personally don ' t care much what url we use : the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important . of course , a change in url now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again . . .
2 ) ubs ( in the form of matt meinel , who feels mike hutchins will be in agreement with him ) do not want us to redirect traffic from www . enrononline . com to the new site , as they feel that promotes too much of an association with enron . i disagree with their position , but don ' t think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name . also , the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement .
please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed . we are ready to put the splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow , but these 11 th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and i feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name .

dow jones news service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
houston - ( dow jones ) - dynegy inc . ( dyn ) terminated its troubled merger agreement with enron corp . ( ene ) , backing away from the deal despite frantic last - minute attempts by both sides to save it .
dynegy wednesday cited enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , convenants and agreements , including the material adverse change provision .
the announcement came after standard & poor ' s cut the beleaguered energy trader ' s debt rating to b - minus , essentially rendering it to junk status .
the downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that enron will be forced to file for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code . that could be a fatal blow for enron , which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive .
standard & poor ' s lowered its long - term rating on enron to b - minus from triple - b - minus , citing fears that dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase of enron .
the collapse of the dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on enron ' s credit profile because of enron ' s limited access to capital at a time when extensive debt restructuring is necessary , s & p said .
"" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this doesn ' t reflect a failure for the energy merchant business , "" dynegy said in announcing its decision .
however , dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are solid , and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added volatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of enron .
in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down $ 2 . 91 , or 71 % , to $ 1 . 20 . dynegy , meanwhile , was down $ 4 . 08 , or 10 % , at $ 36 . 81 , also on the big board .
top executives of enron and dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine the two energy - trading companies amid growing signs that enron faced cash - flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business .
talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all - stock transaction after enron ' s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn ' t be as high as originally anticipated . last month dynegy agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation .
citing a person familiar with the situation , the wall street journal said wednesday that enron ' s board late tuesday had informally agreed to a new share - exchange ratio of 0 . 12 shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered , down more than 50 % from the original offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share .
that latest proposed share - exchange ratio valued enron at $ 4 . 91 a share , or a total of $ 4 . 17 billion . that would compare with the original value of $ 10 . 98 a share , or $ 9 . 33 billion . in exchange for reducing the purchase price , some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company . dynegy also was considering an additional $ 250 million cash investment in enron . dynegy , together with chevrontexaco inc . ( cvx ) , has already injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company .
while struggling to keep the planned merger alive , enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings . enron has a total of about $ 13 billion of debt , of which about $ 9 billion comes due by the end of next year . last month enron said in a filing with the sec that a cut in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit rating agencies - along with a decline in its stock price below certain levels - would trigger the need to repay , refinance or cash collateralize facilities totaling $ 3 . 9 billion .
dynegy said wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of enron natural gas pipeline unit northern natural , omaha , neb . , and said it has exercised its right to acquire the unit ' s common shares .
chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , contributed $ 1 . 5 billion to the proposed enron merger , and dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline unit .

dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to dynegy ' s own energy delivery network .

energy markets seen surviving enron ' s woes , but changed

new york - ( dow jones ) - the energy markets built by enron corp . ( ene ) will survive the company ' s troubles , but they won ' t emerge unscathed , traders and analysts said wednesday .
energy companies have had weeks to adjust to serious concerns about the houston - based giant ' s creditworthiness , allowing a more or less orderly withdrawal of enron from the market before ratings agencies wednesday downgraded enron ' s credit to junk - bond levels .
nevertheless , liquidity in the north american natural gas and electricity markets is expected to suffer and credit requirements are likely to be tightened in general , creating difficulties for some energy traders .
"" this doesn ' t spell the end of energy trading , "" said one trading manager for an independent power producer . "" the market is much bigger than enron , and that ' s why enron fell . this does spell the spell the end of trading for companies that don ' t have a strong physical asset base for at least a year or two as credit requirements are generally tightened , ""
moreover , small producers of natural gas or electricity that hedged their 2002 output with enron earlier this year - when prices were much higher than they are now - will suffer if enron has trouble fulfilling those commitments .
enron warned in a filing with the securities and exchange commission last week that its ability to continue as a going concern would be threatened if its credit ratings were downgraded to noninvestment grade levels .
news of enron ' s downgrade added 5 cents to 10 cents to natural gas futures at the new york mercantile exchange , as traders covering short positions sent the december contract to $ 2 . 82 per million british thermal units , traders said .
midwestern and southeastern power prices were also said to have risen due to trading inefficiencies after enron turned off its internet - based trading platform enrononline and higher gas prices .
prices have in all those markets have since fallen , but the moves point to the increased volatility and lessened efficiency some analysts and traders expect should enron exit the market entirely .
kyle cooper , energy analyst at salomon smith barney , said traders will have to present wider bid - offer spreads in order to get deals done in markets in which enron provided critical liquidity .
"" one less player , one less market , because of the illiquidity , "" cooper said .
at one time , enron accounted for about a quarter of all trade in the north american gas and power markets .

uk : enron - a pioneer of europe ' s new power markets .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 28 ( reuters ) - u . s . group enron , on the brink of collapse on wednesday , has been a pioneer of energy dealing in europe and its demise would rob utilities across the continent of a key trading partner .
with a european staff of 5 , 000 , offices in most major cities and a lavish headquarters overlooking london ' s buckingham palace , enron created the trading culture now embraced by previously sceptical european utilities as markets open up to competition .
until recently , enron had accounted for about 30 percent of german wholesale power trading . it was also a major player in uk gas and electricity and nordic power , and was driving forward a fledgling french power market .
"" on average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties , "" enron ' s director of continental power trading gregor baeumerich told reuters in an interview last month , days before the group was plunged into its current crisis .
britain ' s forward gas market rallied on wednesday as it emerged that a rescue deal from smaller rival dynegy had unravelled and enron looked to be skating dangerously close to bankruptcy .
enron ' s list of trading partners included major utilities such as german giants e . on and rwe and the uk ' s innogy and british energy
u . s . companies with trading desk in europe , such as txu , aep , dynegy and duke energy , also traded with enron .
the company ' s enrononline internet trading platform , suspended earlier on wednesday , set the standard for online trading , offering a blueprint followed by utilities and brokers .
enron did about 60 percent of its trade through the platform .
the group ' s presence in europe is not confined to trading . the company has around 4 , 000 megawatts of power generation , spanning italy , poland , greece and the uk where it owns one of the biggest plants at teesside .
the company built a reputation for hard - nosed trading expertise in europe ' s previously pedestrian utilities industry and its approach seemed almost evangelical .
in the summer , flushed with confidence , the company placed a bmw sports car in the lobby of its london office , a prize for employees successful in recruiting fresh talent for the enron cause .

usa : wrapup 2 - enron near collapse after dynegy pulls out .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . swooned at the edge of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc . blew apart .
dynegy accused enron of breaching the representations it made when a takeover agreement was negotiated on nov . 9 , invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the all - stock deal valued at $ 9 . 3 billion at the time .
shares of enron , recently ranked no . 7 on the fortune 500 list of the biggest u . s . companies , had lost most of their value in the past three weeks , and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on enron ' s bonds to junk status by the time dynegy made its announcement .
enron ' s latest disaster marked another low in a stunning free - fall that began innocently enough with the announcement of a $ 638 million quarterly loss six weeks ago . surprise disclosures , including the admission it overstated earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 and kept huge debts off its balance sheet , led investors to rapidly lose faith in a company valued at almost $ 80 billion a little more than a year ago .
on wednesday , its market value was less than $ 500 million .
in response to dynegy ' s announcements and credit rating downgrades , enron said it will temporary suspend all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core operations .
kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said the company was evaluating and exploring other options to protect its core energy businesses .
the loss of enron ' s investment - grade credit rating forces some $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to come due immediately , a major problem for a company that has spent most of the $ 5 . 5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat . enron said in a recent regulatory filing that it was unlikely to "" continue as a going concern "" were its credit rating to be slashed to junk status .
it became increasingly clear , as dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal , that enron ' s tricky and often indecipherable accounting was becoming a sticking point , sources close to the negotiations said .
"" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business , "" dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement .
dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline with the $ 1 . 5 billion it and partner chevrontexaco put into the deal .
dynegy said it stopped trading with enron as of wednesday morning , pegging its exposure at $ 75 million .
a bad sign came earlier on wednesday , as energy traders said operations had stopped at enron ' s once highly lucrative online trading system , enrononline . the unit accounted for up to 90 percent of enron ' s earnings , and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that dynegy coveted most in its planned $ 9 . 3 billion all - stock takeover .
risk management failures
enron , which touted itself as an agile risk manager , found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks .
the partnerships , which included top enron executives and are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation , provided financing in exchange for guarantees that enron ' s stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment - grade . but they came back onto the balance sheet with a vengeance , as enron found it would have to meet massive debt obligations as its shares and credit fell .
enron shares plunged $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , to 61 cents on wednesday , as the new york stock exchange twice halted trading of enron shares before announcements affecting the company . it ' s stock has fallen more than 98 percent this year .
the stock peaked at $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 , riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena .
"" they ( enron ) entrapped the sophisticates , "" said robert stovall , senior strategist at prudential securities , referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for enron by institutional investors . "" i think this is going to become a classic case . ""
stovall , with nearly 50 years of wall street experience , said he could not recall any previous corporate unraveling that matches that of enron .
"" you would have to go to pre - sec days for that , "" he said , referring to the creation of the sec in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 .
the final cuts
standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch all cut their ratings on the fallen energy trading giant ' s debt to junk status . s & p said it had lost confidence in enron ' s ability to complete the merger with dynegy , and said bankruptcy was a "" distinct possibility "" if the merger fails .
andre meade , a commerzbank analyst who has been consistently bearish on enron and the deal , said its core business deteriorated at an increasing pace in recent weeks , and the ratings agencies could not find the liquidity they wanted inside enron .
"" the numbers were not enough to soothe them , "" said meade , who downgraded enron to "" sell "" from "" hold "" on wednesday . "" this company should have been downgraded to junk weeks ago . the ratings agencies had given them several weeks , and they just couldn ' t hold out anymore . ""
dynegy on nov . 9 said it would take over enron in a deal valued at about $ 10 . 41 per enron share . chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , pledged to immediately pump $ 1 . 5 billion into enron to bolster its withering finances .
deal advisers j . p . morgan chase and citigroup have already contributed $ 1 billion to the deal , and were expected to have to put up after enron was rebuffed by private equity firms it had approached seeking more cash .
representatives of dynegy and enron had haggled over new terms for the takeover late into tuesday , including a buyout offer half the original price , sources close to the talks said .
enron ' s crash began when it said it would take $ 1 . 01 billion in writedowns and charges against its third - quarter earnings for failed investments . it later admitted that it had to reduce stockholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion to extract itself from partnerships in which now - ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow the managing partner .
those deals , in which fastow earned about $ 30 million in management fees , are the subject of an sec investigation and the . worse yet for enron , it was required to restate its earnings going back four years , shaving off $ 600 million in the process .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp ' s internet - based energy and metals trading system was shut down on wednesday , shortly after a leading credit - rating agency downgraded the company ' s debt to "" junk "" status , energy traders said .
it was not clear whether the enrononline trading system was halted deliberately or by a technical problem . enron officials were not immediately available for comment .
"" we were watching the board and suddenly it went blank , "" said one northeast natural gas trader . activity on enrononline was halted just after 11 a . m . ( 1600 gmt ) , the trader said .
energy traders said the standard & poor ' s announcement that it was downgrading enron debt triggered a brief spike in new york mercantile exchange natural gas futures , to $ 2 . 82 per million btu , but prices later slipped to the low - $ 2 . 70 s , still up more than 11 cents from tuesday .
"" we spiked on the enron news . people ran in to cover any exposure because of the uncertainty . i think they ' re expecting the company to file for chapter 11 ( bankruptcy ) , "" said one midwest gas and power trader .
"" the enron ( stock ) halt sent a shock through the ( power ) market and all trading stopped . the enron guys pulled all their numbers ( on enrononline ) , "" another trader at a houston - based energy firm said .
u . s . natural gas and electricity firms have been steadily scaling back deals with enron for several weeks as fears mounted about the former energy giant ' s credit standing .

enron was by far the largest u . s . natural gas and electricity trader , with industry analysts estimating it was once involved in some 20 percent of daily trade in those markets .
but since last month , when the company became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation of financial dealings with partnerships , the houston - based company ' s market share has steadily eroded .

washington , nov 28 ( reuters ) - the chairman of the u . s . house energy and commerce committee said on wednesday he could not see how the government could come to the rescue of enron corp . , near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it .
"" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , "" said billy tauzin , republican of louisiana .
but he said the government must watch carefully whether the troubles of the houston - based enron - once ranked as the nation ' s largest trader of electricity and natural gas - had implications for u . s . energy supplies and pricing .
tauzin noted that enron had been a "" very big contributor "" to energy supplies in california , which was rocked last winter by a tenfold jump in wholesale electricity prices , a string of black - outs and the bankruptcy of the state ' s largest utility .
"" we ' ve got to watch that very carefully , obviously . we don ' t want to be in another session next year trying to deal with energy problems in california as a result of some of the events that are occurring right now with enron , "" tauzin said .
the underlying cause of california ' s problems last winter was widely seen as the state ' s badly written electricity deregulation law , which did not allow power companies to pass through higher wholesale electricity costs to consumers .
tauzin said enron ' s decline was unfortunate . "" it ' s a sad story . it ' s been a hugely successful enterprise . ""
"" i would hope they could work it out . we can ' t simply step into every bad market decision and every bad financing decision that occurs in american corporations in this country and work it out for them . we have to count on them to figure it out themselves . ""
"" our job is going to be to make sure in policy we haven ' t left a breach open where consumers are going to end up short or overpriced in the process , "" he added .
enron ' s financial problems have steadily unravelled since last month , when it became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation of some enron partnerships .
on wednesday , dynergy said it called off its plan to buy enron in a $ 9 billion stock deal , citing breaches in the merger agreement . the company ' s credit ratings were downgraded to junk status .

san francisco , nov 28 ( reuters ) - nymex hub gas , up midday wednesday on enron corp . ' s financial troubles , tumbled late after bearish aga data was released this afternoon , traders said .
"" healthy supplies continue to be confirmed week after week with these aga reports . until we see a guy in chicago with ice coming off his nose we will go lower because supplies are abundant and there ' s no demand , "" one northeast trader said .
the trader said front - month nymex prices could fall below $ 2 per mmbtu in the days ahead if widespread and sustainable cold weather failed to materialize .
at 2 : 48 p . m . est , december was down 40 . 6 cents at $ 2 . 20 per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) after aga data was released .
earlier in the session , december , which expires today , rocketed to $ 2 . 82 after standard & poor ' s cut energy trading giant enron ' s debt to junk status , a move that threw into question the company ' s ability to meet its financial obligations .
enron is by far the largest u . s . gas and electricity trader , with industry analysts estimating it was once involved in some 20 percent of daily trade in those markets .
aga storage data released this afternoon showed u . s . gas stocks for the week ended nov . 23 rose by 12 bcf , well above reuters survey estimates for an unchanged - to 5 bcf withdrawal number , the year - ago slide of 146 bcf and the five - year average pull of 66 bcf .
total inventories of 3 . 144 tcf jumped to 642 bcf , or 26 percent , above last year and 391 bcf above the five year average .
last week , storage , which stands at 95 percent full , broke the all - time record high of 3 . 127 tcf hit on nov . 6 , 1998 .
most analysts expect the gas glut to grow further in coming weeks , noting last year more than 1 tcf was drawn from inventory during a record cold november - december period .
eastern stocks were unchanged at 98 percent of capacity , about 15 percent above last year . consuming region west storage , which rose 3 bcf for the week , was 46 percent above year - ago levels . inventories in the producing region gained 13 bcf and stood 41 percent above 2000 levels .
the national weather service 6 - 10 day forecast , released late tuesday , called for above normal temperatures for the eastern two - thirds of the nation , with seasonal or below seasonal readings expected in the west .
chart traders said the technical picture remained bearish , particularly with cash still more than 70 cents below the screen , and most said they needed a december close below the november low of $ 2 . 482 to signal another leg lower .
below $ 2 . 482 , december support was pegged at the contract low of $ 2 . 415 and then in the $ 2 . 14 area and at $ 2 . 00 .
december resistance was seen first in the $ 3 . 00 area and then at the $ 3 . 15 - 3 . 208 gap and the high from four weeks ago of $ 3 . 44 .
in the cash today , henry hub swing quotes fell on average 43 cents to $ 2 . 30 . most cash dealers pinned the steep rise to cooler weather and uncertainty over enron ' s future .
midwest pipes jumped 20 to 30 cents to the $ 2 . 50 area . in the west , gas at waha hub in west texas was around 20 cents higher in the mid - $ 2 . 50 s .
swing gas on transco at the new york city gate soared about 60 cents to $ 2 . 72 , while chicago was almost 30 cents higher at $ 2 . 49 .
nymex said an estimated 33 , 265 henry hub contracts traded at 11 : 05 a . m . est .
nymex has been holding abbreviated floor trading sessions following the sept . 11 attacks on the world trade center .
nymex gas open outcry trade will run from 10 : 00 a . m . to 2 : 30 p . m . , with the internet - based access session held from 3 : 15 p . m . to 9 : 00 a . m . , through dec . 31 .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones less than a year ago , they were trading at $ 84 . 87 . dynegy shares were off $ 4 . 08 , or 10 percent , to $ 36 . 81 .
in a statement , dynegy said enron had breached its acquisition agreement , triggering a "" material adverse "" clause and causing it to call of the deal .
"" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business , "" said dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson .
the dynegy move came after standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service both cited a loss of confidence that the deal will be consummated , and said that dynegy ' s willingness to go through with the buyout has been compromised by continued erosion in investor confidence and enron ' s core energy trading business .
the downgrades make $ 3 . 9 billion of enron debt due immediately , and up to $ 16 billion in other debt originally due next year could come due earlier .
in its statement , dynegy also said it would exercise its right to purchase enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline , an option it received after it and chevrontexaco - which holds a 26 percent stake in dynegy - pumped $ 1 . 5 million into the ailing enron .
despite dynegy ' s claim to the pipeline , analysts are anticipating a battle over enron ' s assets in bankruptcy court .
"" it ' s going to be a fight "" between dynegy and enron ' s creditors , howald said .
spokesmen for both enron and dynegy didn ' t immediately return repeated calls seeking comment wednesday , though dynegy scheduled a conference call for later in the afternoon .
enron and dynegy , both based in houston , had spent the last several days trying to hammer out a revision to their nov . 9 merger agreement , which valued enron stock at more than $ 10 per share .
"" this comes in response to the fact that they weren ' t able to craft a deal last night . they were working on getting more cash ( from banks shepherding the merger ) last night , but they didn ' t get it , "" said a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim said . "" i think bankruptcy ' s not too far away . ""
raymond james analyst jon kyle cartwright predicted dynegy will survive with a few battle scars .
"" i believe we all misunderstood how dramatic a credibility crisis can be in a recession in a bear market , "" he said . "" the speed at which enron collapsed caught us all off guard . ""
enron last month revealed that partnerships run by its executives had allowed the company to keep about half a billion in debt off its books and allowed the executives to profit from the arrangements . enron ' s dealings with those partnerships are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation .
the company ousted its top financial officer in october , and several weeks ago restated its earnings back to 1997 - eliminating more than $ 580 million in reported income .

2001 - 11 - 28 13 : 09 ( new york )
dynegy pull out of enron purchase ; credit ratings cut ( update 6 )
( updates to add dynegy comment ; share price . )
new york , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . abandoned its
proposed purchase of enron corp . , said dynegy in a press
statement . the decision threatens to force enron , once the
country ' s largest energy trader , into bankruptcy .
standard & poor ' s corp . cut enron ' s credit rating to junk as
bankers failed to raise $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until
the deal was completed . the lack of funds and the prospect of a
downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision to scrap the
acquisition , which was valued at $ 23 billion on nov . 9 .
enron shares fell as much as 71 percent to $ 1 . 20 , its lowest
level in at least 19 years . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which
mature in 2006 , were quoted at 20 cents on the dollar , down from
53 yesterday . at that price the bonds yield 57 percent .
` ` the reality is enron ' s going bankrupt , ' ' said michael
willingham , a risk manager at itochu international inc . ` ` enron
touted themselves as the king of risk management , but it doesn ' t
look like they ' ve managed their risk very well . ' '
bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .
lee tried for for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed .
investors including saudi prince alwaleed bin talal , the
blackstone group lp and the carlyle group inc . turned them down
because of concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . that
concern was heightened after enron disclosed a previously
undisclosed $ 690 million interest payment due this week .
dynegy said in a statement distributed by business wire that
it terminated its agreement because enron breached covenants .
chairman and ceo chuck watson said dynegy would invoke its right
to purchase enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline . dynegy used an
investment of $ 1 . 5 billion from chevrontexaco corp . , which owns
one quarter of dynegy , to purchase the enron unit , which operates
16 , 500 miles of natural gas pipeline .
enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls for
comment .
trading doubts
enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading
partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay
bills . as a result , they either demanded more collateral to trade
or restricting trading with the houston - based company .
enrononline , enron corp . ' s online trading system , stopped
allowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gas
late this morning , say traders who use the web site . enron said
yesterday that enrononline handles about 60 percent of its trading
business , or about $ 2 . 8 billion a day in trading on average over
the last 30 days .
` ` we can log in , but there is nothing there , nothing to buy
and nothing to sell , ' ' said juha laiho , an energy trader at
finland - based fortum oyj in houston . ` ` it went down some time
this morning . ' '
s in both 1998
and 1999 , it had been less than a majority .
participants in the plan , which had $ 2 . 14 billion in assets
available for benefits , could only do so much to diversify their
investments . enron , like many other companies , used stock rather
than cash to match employee contributions and restricted sales of
the shares .
and they could only guess at the year - end makeup of the plan ' s
assets until the end of june , reflecting sec disclosure standards
for savings plans . by that time , the stock ' s drop - - which reached
99 percent today - - was already well under way .
trio of lawsuits
enron later reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter charges ;
ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran partnerships
that accounted for some of the charges ; restated its results since
1997 ; became the target of an sec accounting investigation ; and
accepted a takeover bid from dynegy inc . , its biggest rival .
the company ' s shares , which ended last year at $ 83 . 13 , fell as
low as $ 1 . 05 today before a midday trading halt as enron ' s debt was
downgraded to junk - bond status and dynegy abandoned its offer .
in response to the plunge , employees in the 401 ( k ) plan - -
which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax - free
savings , and takes its name from a section of the internal revenue
service code - - have filed three lawsuits against enron .
the suits allege , among other things , that the houston - based
company prevented employees from shifting investments within the
plan between oct . 17 , the day after its disclosure of the charges ,
and nov . 19 as the company made administrative changes .
all three seek class - action status on behalf of the plan ' s
participants . the most recent filing came from the gottesdiener law
firm , based in washington , on monday . it covers the longest time
period : november 1995 to now .
falling percentages
enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan ' s
assets at the end of 1994 , the year before the period associated
with the gottesdiner suit began . the figure reflected a one - time
company contribution of preferred stock , and rose from 62 percent
in 1993 .
each preferred share has a face value of $ 100 and is
convertible into 27 . 304 common shares . this translates into a
conversion price of $ 3 . 66 a share , which was a bargain before
today ' s trading .
the plan also owned a stake in enron ' s former oil and gas
unit , which became eog resources inc . after gaining independence in
1999 . add in those shares , and company stock represented about two -
thirds of the 1994 assets .
enron ' s common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of
401 ( k ) assets available for benefits in 1995 , 58 percent in 1996
and 53 percent in 1997 as the u . s . stock market rallied , lifting
the value of participants ' investments in equity mutual funds .
the shares represented 49 percent of the plan ' s assets in
1998 . the proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999 , when the
assets more than doubled - - exceeding the 56 percent increase in
enron ' s share price that year - - to $ 1 . 62 billion .
how much choice ?
then came last year , when the common shares recorded their
best performance in more than two decades even as u . s . stocks
stumbled . enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and
natural gas prices , while the standard & poor ' s 500 index , a market
benchmark that includes the company , fell 10 percent .
company shares in the plan rose in value by $ 652 . 7 million ,
according to an sec filing . the total includes shares bought and
sold throughout the year . by contrast , mutual - fund holdings fell by
$ 47 million and ` ` other investments ' ' rose by just $ 134 , 000 , the
filing said .
at year - end , the 401 ( k ) plan owned 13 . 9 million enron common
shares and 70 , 000 preferred shares , valued at $ 1 . 32 billion . this
total encompasses not only enron ' s matching contributions to the
plan , but also employees ' investments with their own money .
the company generally provides a 50 percent match , in stock ,
for the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan . employees
can ' t sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment
choices until they reach the age of 50 .
company contributions accounted for about 11 percent of the
plan ' s stock holdings , said karen denne , an enron spokeswoman . the
figure suggests employees invested more heavily in their company
than usual for 401 ( k ) participants .
waiting for data
for the average u . s . plan account , company stock amounted to
19 percent of assets at the end of last year , according to a study
done by the employee benefit research institute and the investment
company institute and published last week .
in any case , enron ' s approach to matching ensures that as much
as one - third of the contribution to an employee ' s account takes the
form of shares that they can ' t sell right away .
anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach , and enron ' s
stock performance , affected the plan ' s financial position last year
had to wait until june 27 . that ' s when the filing cited earlier
arrived at the sec .
employee savings and stock - purchase plans , such as 401 ( k )
plans , don ' t have to submit annual reports until 180 days after
their fiscal year ends . they can even get a 15 - day extension of the
deadline if they need one .
by the time enron ' s plan made its annual report , it was
already a bit too late to act on the information . the company ' s
shares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of
the submission . as the filing demonstrated , employees looking to
save for retirement had been set up for a fall .
enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 )

enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 )
( updates with analyst comment in third paragraph , fitch
rating in fourth paragraph and shares in sixth paragraph . )
new york , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s
investors service and fitch , inc . slashed enron corp . ' s credit
rating to junk status as rival energy trader dynegy inc . rescinded
its buyout bid for the company .
the cut could force enron into bankruptcy . at least $ 3 . 9
billion in debt comes due immediately because of the rating cut ,
and the company struggles with a cash crunch as it suspends its
online trading unit and some ` ` non - core ' ' payments . enron ' s
trading business is also faltering as trading partners lose faith
in the company ' s ability to meet its obligations .
` ` this is a disaster , ' ' said jon kyle cartwright , a debt
analyst at raymond james and associates . ` ` it is difficult , if not
impossible , for anyone to do trades with enron ' s trading
operations in light of junk ratings across the board and dynegy
walking away from the deal . ' '
s & p reduced enron ' s long - term grade six levels to ` ` b - ' ' from
` ` bbb - ' ' and withdrew its ` ` a ' ' short - term rating . moody ' s cut
enron ' s credit rating to ` ` b 2 , ' ' five levels below investment
grade , from ` ` baa 3 , ' ' the lowest investment level . moody ' s
affirmed its ` ` not - prime ' ' rating on enron ' s commercial paper .
fitch cut enron ' s senior unsecured rating 10 levels , to
` ` cc ' ' from ` ` bbb - , ' ' and its short term rating to its second -
lowest ` ` c ' ' from ` ` f 3 . ' ' fitch said a ` ` default of some kind
appears probable . ' '
deterioration
` ` we saw the deterioration in the trading operations , and
that threw the merger in doubt , ' ' said s & p analyst todd shipman
and the author of the report .
enron has $ 15 . 5 billion of debt outstanding , according to
bloomberg data . its shares , which have fallen 99 . 2 percent so far
this year , lost $ 3 . 34 cents today and are now trading at 77 cents .
enron ' s stock had fallen by more than 50 percent since nov .
19 amid growing skepticism that the dynegy would complete the
acquisition .
` ` we became a lot more concerned when the stock didn ' t
stabilize , ' ' said john diaz , moody ' s managing director for energy
and one of the authors of the report . ` ` the drop in the stock
price put pressure on dynegy to renegotiate the deal . ' '
cash burn
shipman said in his report that ` ` the willingness of dynegy
to complete its planned acquisition of enron has been compromised
by the continued drop in confidence in the capital markets that
the transaction would hold . ' '
credit analysts also focused on enron ' s ` ` cash burn ' ' rate ,
diaz said . enron said in its most recent filing last week that it
had $ 1 billion in cash , which was a lot less than the market had
expected , diaz said .
` ` it came as a surprise to us and to others , ' ' he said . ` ` we
expected at least $ 2 . 5 billion so they would have staying power . ' '
enron expected to sell portland utility to northwest natural
2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 07 ( new york )
enron expected to sell portland utility to northwest natural
portland , oregon , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the
nearly bankrupt energy trader , is expected to go through with the
sale of its portland general electric co . unit to northwest
natural gas co . , a spokesman for the utility owner said .
enron last month agreed to sell pge to northwest natural for
$ 2 . 9 billion in cash , stock and assumed debt . dynegy inc . today
called off its planned purchase of enron , saying the energy trader
breached covenants in the merger agreement . dynegy had supported
the pge sale .
northwest natural filed its application to buy pge with the
oregon public utility commission today . enron representatives have
given the portland , oregon - based company no indication that they
plan to call off the sale , northwest natural spokesman steve
sechrist said .
` ` we think the transaction will be completed , ' ' sechrist
said . ` ` whatever happens to enron , the deal has significant
benefits for customers and shareholders of both their company and
our company . ' '
a spokeswoman for houston - based enron didn ' t return calls for
comment . pge spokesman scott simms said he couldn ' t comment on
enron ' s planned sale of the utility .
northwest natural shares fell 32 cents to $ 24 . 02 in
midafternoon trading . enron shares fell $ 2 . 91 to $ 1 . 20 before
trading was halted for dynegy ' s announcement . enron shares have
dropped 99 percent since the first of the year .
commission ' s role
marc hellman , the administrator responsible for mergers and
acquisitions at the oregon public utility commission , said he is
unsure what would happen if enron were to file for bankruptcy
protection .
` ` i can ' t recall it ever happening , and i ' ve been here for
22 years , ' ' hellman said . ` ` if it went all the way to the end ,
where they ' re liquidating assets , you can ' t sell utility property
without commission approval . there are probably some issues where
our attorney general ' s office may look into it . ' '
hellman said he has heard nothing to indicate northwest
natural ' s purchase of pge wouldn ' t go forward .
` ` enron was getting cash from northwest natural for the
purchase , as well as shares , ' ' hellman said . ` ` that aspect of the
transaction becomes a little curious if enron is going through
bankruptcy . ' '
debt downgrades
moody ' s investors service today downgraded pge ' s senior
secured debt to a 3 from a 2 . moody ' s also downgraded pge ' s
unsecured debt , its junior subordinated debt and its preferred
stock .
the ratings service said it had expected to downgrade pge ' s
ratings once northwest natural completed its acquisition of the
utility .
` ` however , today ' s rating action is being taken in advance of
the expected closing of that transaction to reflect moody ' s
concerns surrounding portland general ' s ability to remain fully
insulated from the many financial challenges currently being faced
by its parent , enron corp . , due in large part to lost investor
confidence in enron , ' ' moody ' s said in a statement .

sempra energy interested in buying some enron assets ( update 2 )

fourth . )
san diego , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - sempra energy , an owner of
electric and natural - gas utilities , is interested in buying some
of enron corp . ' s assets now that the energy trader ' s planned
merger with dynegy inc . has failed , a sempra spokesman said .
` ` we are interested in some of enron ' s hard assets and our
interest would lie in those assets that would have synergies with
our own operations , ' ' sempra spokesman doug kline said . ` ` beyond
that i couldn ' t give you more specifics . ' '
dynegy today called off its purchase of enron , saying the
energy trader breached covenants in the merger agreement . dynegy
had agreed to buy enron for at least $ 23 billion in stock and
assumed debt this month . a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities at enron had limited its ability to finance
operations and sent its shares plunging .
sempra shares fell 39 cents to $ 22 . 66 in late trading . enron
shares fell $ 3 . 48 to 63 cents once they resumed trading after a
halt for dynegy ' s announcement . enron shares have dropped
99 percent since the first of the year .
houston - based enron has an ownership interest in argentina ' s
4 , 104 - mile natural - gas pipeline system , the largest pipeline
system in south america . sempra energy international owns a
43 percent stake in two natural - gas utility holding companies in
argentina . sempra also is the owner of the san diego gas &
electric and southern california gas co . utilities .
` ` we are looking at selling our global assets that are not
core to our business , and so we ' ll be continuing with an asset -
sale program , ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne said . ` ` we are not
going to comment on who we ' ve had discussions with or what the
status of those is . ' '
in addition to its interest in enron assets , sempra has had
discussions with enron employees who want to leave the company ,
kline said .
` ` a number of enron employees have approached us , as we ' re
aware they ' ve approached other firms , ' ' kline said .
enron office tower project in limbo after dynegy ends purchase
2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 42 ( new york )
enron office tower project in limbo after dynegy ends purchase
houston , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s 1 . 17 - million -
square - foot office tower project in downtown houston has been
thrown into limbo after dynegy inc . abandoned its proposed
purchase of the country ' s largest energy trader .
the 40 - story tower at 1500 louisiana , next to enron ' s
current headquarters , is scheduled to be completed in january ,
according to hines interests , the construction manager .
the building , the first new houston skyscraper since 1987 ,
features floors as large as 52 , 00 square feet to accommodate
enron ' s trading activities and a circular sky bridge nicknamed
` ` the saturn ring ' ' that connects the new tower with enron ' s
existing building and a parking garage .
` ` dynegy occupies 700 , 000 square feet in houston and the
thinking was that after they bought enron they would move their
operations into the new tower , ' ' said will penland , senior
managing director at property broker cb richard ellis ' s houston
office . ` ` i guess that has fallen by the wayside now . ' '
enron ' s shares tumbled $ 3 . 42 to 69 cents in late trading as
investors and analysts said the company may be forced into
bankruptcy . standard & poor ' s corp . cut enron ' s credit rating to
junk as bankers failed to raise $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to
operate until the deal was completed . enron said it is suspending
all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core
operations .
the cesar pelli & associates - designed tower , called enron
center south , is clad in reflective glass and metal panels , and
features sun shades on its south face , according to hines . the
building ' s seven - story base includes five 52 , 000 square - foot
floors . each of the top 33 stories is 25 , 000 square feet .
when the project was announced two years ago , enron needed
more space to house a growing workforce . its stock price hit a
peak of $ 90 a share in august 2000 .
the project kicked off a building boom for houston , with
three other buildings now under construction that would add 2 . 05
million square feet to the city ' s office supply , according to
prudential financial . the largest of these is a reliant resources
project at 100 main street .
this activity , combined with falling energy prices and job
cuts at compaq computer corp . , continental airlines inc . , and
other houston employers , may cause the city ' s downtown office
vacancy rate to rise to the ` ` mid - teens ' ' in 2002 from 8 . 2
percent at the end of september , according to james sullivan ,
prudential ' s real estate analyst .",0

re : final draft of power gtc ( really eei ) for online trading with,"credit terms ( unilateral )
attached are clean and marked copies of the online trading gtcs for physical power which i have generally discussed with bryan murtagh ( ubs ) . you will note that we have elected to use the eei form by incorporation as we believe this will be the most marketable approach understanding that different forms will be required for many players , eg wspp .
i will be doing a final review over the weekend and expect this form to be final by monday am . if you have any questions / comments , please let me know .
by copy of this email to genia , i would ask for her help in cleaning up the document ( sorry , beyond my current skills , hopefully , soon to be broadened ) and would ask leslie to carefully review and provide me any thoughts / comments . based upon this document , we will have ready by monday pm , the long form eei for regular negotiation .

subject : your input for management conference
hi louise ,
congratulations on your baby and welcome back .
i ' m preparing the agenda for enron ' s annual management conference again this year . i was hoping i could ask for your insight as i ' m compiling the program .
this year ' s conference theme plays off of our new vision , "" becoming the world ' s leading company . "" however , the feeling at enron is quite different this year because of the depressed stock price , california , india , broadband , etc . i ' d welcome your thoughts on what the tone for the conference should be , i . e . subdued optimism , reenergizing , etc .
on a related subject , ken lay and jeff skilling will both have an hour on the agenda to speak . this is in response to feedback from employees saying they want to hear more from each of them . afterall , they are both top notch industry speakers . rather than have them give a current "" state of the company "" address , i intend to have them focus on bigger company , industry or market topics . i ' d love your thoughts on this as well . ( i believe jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision , and as an economist , ken could give valuable insight into what ' s happening in the market . )
finally , i ' d welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker . i ' d very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1 . ) enron people admire ; and 2 . ) has undergone some difficult period in their company ' s history . jeff personally extended an invitation to steve ballmer from microsoft , but he is unable to attend . is there someone you think would be interesting ?
i truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue . i look forward to your thoughts and ideas .

are we ok to go forward on neil ? last time we talked you seemed ok with internal transfers as long as there was no increase in pay or title . not sure on the relocations from london in light of the current situation . may want to hold on them until things settle down and we know the impact on the houston staffing . my guess is that we will have a lot of very strong people in houston available .

can you confirm whether we have put a hold on all internal transfers . i heard this but wanted to confirm . i have been approached by several very dtrong people in other groups and i do think we need to address how we handle in light of any potential upcoming reductions .
specifically , there is one individual still in broadband , neil carpino , that everyone would like to have join berney / edith / terry . there are two individuals in europe , posey martinez and elizabeth johnston that would be good fits as well . i am holding off on all moves until there is more clarity .
any info or insight you might provide would be helpful .
