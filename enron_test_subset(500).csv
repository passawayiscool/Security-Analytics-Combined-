re : green card,"sevil ,
i believe you and margret daffin have spoken about the next steps for your
green card . you will need to start working on you hib at the begining of
october 2001 .
if there is any confusion on my part please let me know .

below is dicussion between margret daffin and sevil in an e : mail january 26 ,
2001 :
"" sevil : first of all we have to get you an hib visa before we can work on
getting you the green card .
after you get your opt , contact me sometime in the summer and i will start
working on your hib visa which we will obtain in approx . october , 2001 . we
cannot start the green card process when you are still on an fl visa - you
have to be on an hib visa . there is no rush - you will have six years on the
hib visa - plenty of time in which to get the green card . ""
this was in reference to her note to me , as follows :
"" i think i ' ll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and
opt . this makes almost two years . if we can start green card process now , do
you think that i would get it before i need hl . in every case , can ' t we start
green card before i get hl ? because i don ' t want to waste these two years
given the fact that green card process is a long process . ""

"meeting with vince set for 1 pm monday , april 17","maureen , thank you very much for taking time away from your project to talk
with me this morning . since the management decision to close info central , i
have been doing small projects that , while necessary , do not require my
education , knowledge or research capabilities .
i appreciate your suggestion that i speak to vince since i am anxious to
return to contributing at a higher level . i am attaching my resume in the
hope that it will trigger ideas for possible ways that i can use my abilities
in the research department . i have worked as an information specialist for
14 years , doing research for people at all levels in both the pharmaceutical
and energy industries . i have focused most heavily on business research , but
learn quickly and can branch out in whatever direction necessary for a
project .
i ' m looking forward to meeting with vince on monday afternoon . thanks again
for your help .",0

password . the enron code of ethics prohibits the sharing of passwords and
logging on as another person . please observe enron  , s policy .
if you can ' t log in to the system , go to the it central web page from the

call the isc help desk at 713 - 345 - 4 sap ( 4727 ) .
accounting coding
no changes in coding are being implemented as a result of the transition from

i hope you ' re very well . as you can see , i am now working for the ft ' s
magazine publishing business ; i have responsibility for what ' s currently
termed
the expatriate division and i ' ve just passed my statutory probationary period
of 3 months . apologies for not contacting you sooner - but i guess you knew
you ' d hear from me sooner or later , especially when i need help ! having
gotten
thru probation , i am set loose upon new projects . . . . . . i ' m investigating
several
ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on
one of them .
very basically , i want to develop a magazine product for the international
private investor , specifically
o hnwis
o owner - managers
o results - oriented but intelligent investor with long - term investment goals
and
a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and / or brokers on
something approaching equal terms
the product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of
private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for
themselves . the product would aim to cover the major asset classes , including
the "" wilder shores "" such as hedge funds and emerging markets . i am working on
a
portal site ( imaginatively entitled ftexpat . com ! ) , nested within ft . com , which
will launch in october ; international investment will be a significant channel
on the site , and a key distribution / marketing channel for this ( and future )
offering . at this very early stage i am testing out the reaction to the notion
of such a product - do you have one ? would you be able to suggest any other
contacts who might be willing / able to share their thoughts with me ? i know
it ' s
not bang in your sphere but i ' m hoping you ' ll be interested enough to share
your thoughts with me .
if you can give me a few pointers , i ' d be grateful . looking forward to hearing
from you ,

we have figured out why the credit group is getting so many "" new
counterparty "" names in gas . the spreadsheets that they are getting that
information from are for position purposes only on pipe - optons . the value is
captured in tagg and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would
be doublecounting credit risk . the spreadsheet download has a specific
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name ( which in
this case had to be put in as new counterparty . ) i am working with debbie to
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty
at all from the spreadsheet . it will be done as quickly as possible .

subject : bingaman draft on transparency - - amendment ideas
last night , linda and i spent a fairly long time with leon lowery , chairman bingaman ' s chief electricity advisor , to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market - based rate language - - while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard .
we made progress on transparency , less so on market - based rates .
on transparency , leon understands our concerns . in a nutshell , he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction - specific , trade - specific information . we persuaded leon that was the impact of the initial language , although he initially said details would be left to ferc . we persuaded him that if any data is to be provided , it must be only in aggregate form . we also impressed on him that if , as he said , the intent is to leave details to ferc - - then more of the details should be left to ferc , not set by statute .
leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections . this will make it easier for leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff . ( sam fowler , th chief counsel , is a drafting stickler ) .
others should obviously weigh in and review this , but to facilitate internal comments ( we need to get back to leon today ) , here is my take on what he has in mind . under new sec . 218 ( b ) ( to be added to the fpa by bill sec . 413 ) ( pg . 13 ) , under "" information required "" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows :
( 2 ) each broker , exchange , or other market - making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce .
the effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy . by leaving it as aggregate statistical information , this should give ferc maximum flexibility to permit indexes , etc .
as to the "" timely basis "" of information release ( subsection ( c ) ) , the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the internet after the end of the trading day . if we can restrict this to aggregate data , question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily . that suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want , i think . here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give ferc more leeway :
"" ( c ) timely basis - - the commission shall require the information required under subsection ( b ) to be posted on the internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate .
the change is to add "" appropriate "" so that ferc can consider other than whether posting is practicable . the use of "" appropriate "" is what came to mind - - perhaps there is some other word or phrase like "" consistent with . . . "" or "" promote competition "" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability . there should be some valid purpose established before data is released . i would argue that the ( d ) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure , not when disclosure is appropriate .
please let me have your thoughts , although the tragedy in nyc and dc now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the hill .
will provide a further report on market - based rates . in sum , leon was not as sympathetic on this issue , but asked for our ideas and further arguments . we sense leon personally feels strongly about moving the fpa to some linkage to competitive markets . his argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets . we pushed that penalizing us is not the answer - - nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down . leon clearly does not intend this language to punish enron - - but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets .",0

urgent response,"dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you don ' t know me personally . i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr . john da costa , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe , i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you . my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority . before his death he deposited the sum of us $ 15 . 2 million ( fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars ) to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe .
the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "" modus operandi "" adopted by the government .
this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely ; more than fifty - one ( 51 ) people have so far been killed . heads of governments from the west , especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan , subsequently , south african development community ( s . a . d . c . ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land act , it is against this background that i and my
family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband ' s money into a foreign account . as a family , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account , where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth .
and south africa ' s government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "" asylum "" . as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter .
for your assistance , i will offering you 15 % of the total sum , 80 % for my family while 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction . i wish to
invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice .
finally , all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company ' s account in your country .
if this proposal is acceptable by you , please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number + 27724263169 or e - mail address mariadacosta _ 2002 @ yahoo . com
best regards ,
mrs maria da costa ( for the family )",1

take positi 0 ns before breaking news expiosion,"the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term bul | market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us "" oi | belt ""
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oil and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pieased to announce that the
alberta energy & utility board has issued license no . o 3302 o 6 for the
company ' s we | | 11 - 16 - 24 - 2 the acadia project .
the acadia project consists of 15 sections in aiberta in an area that
produces natura | gas from the viking formation , has oi | potential in the
bakken zone and gas potentia | in the coiony and second white specks
zones . the viking contains natura | gas in we | | s around the acadia project
and has the potentia | for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases .
gas welis in the area have calcuiated aof rates up to 14 mmcf per day .
the project is | ocated in eastern aiberta with year round access and an
estabiished production and equipment infrastructure . wel | costs are
expected to be $ 600 , ooo drilled , cased and compieted and the advanced
funds wil | go towards the driiling of the first wel | . each well on a | ease
earns emerson a 49 % working interest in one section .
emerson oil and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pleased to announce that the land

earns emerson a 49 % working interest in one section .
symbol - eogi
price - . o 26
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wiil skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - mi | | ions , eogi is se | | ing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises . already
shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the
past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and
developers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in
the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple
returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiariy ciose attention to undervaiued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this sma | | company
with a comparably smail market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but all that wiil change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive effect on
the share price .
what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? we | | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in
the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or decline
siightiy , you wi | | stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wi | | soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors will be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive
production . early investors wil | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this area wil | really turn up the heat , causing us to revise our
targets upward in next week ' s bulletin .

subject : re : pdo
i ' m not sure what to think , other than we really don ' t have a
credible way to determine what will happen with the pdo . one factor
that provides insight into the climate outlook for the next few months
and next few seasons is the expected changes with enso ( for which
there is some demonstrated skill in forecasting ) . the latest
observations show trends to near - normal enso conditions , with
some indication that ocean temperatures will likely be a bit
warmer than normal in the tropics . if this is true , i ' d expect a slight
bias toward el nino - like climate over north america , which would
tend to go against the continuation of cold phase pdo conditions .

think ge is going to move like that anytime soon ?
reasons to consider eogi :
* emerson oil gas holds a 5 o % working interest in the w . t . davis wel | lands within township 23 north and range 13 west of bossier parish , louisiana . the net revenue interest of the | ease is 75 % . the w . t . davis well is | ocated in the arkana field and initiaily produced from the haynesviile formation of the cotton valley series . with the worldwide focus on energy needs being front and center in the public eye , emerson feels that with its first ciass management and discretionary project choices , the company will continue to serve its sharehoiders we | | .
* emerson is identifying additiona | step out opportunities on its louisiana property .

subject : please reply by wednesday , 8 / 22 - - draft rehearing request - - ferc reporting requirements for california sales
attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order ferc issued in rmol - 9 requiring sellers of gas into california to file information on their sales , transport , and purchases . the rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the nopr that ( 1 ) permanent , formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the commission ' s powers under the natural gas act and ( 2 ) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties ' ability to comply . we also request that the reports , if they must be submitted , be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days .
please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself ( 713 - 853 - 5840 ) or leslie ( 505 - 623 - 6778 ) by cob wednesday ( 8 / 22 ) .

we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :
1 . the tax obligationin your country
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area , as well as ;
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody .

what kind of crude price volatility are you proposing to use ( nymex ) ? as i recall , we did find some relationship between the time series price variable and one of the s & d terms that you had placed in the excel worksheet . there was no relationship with lagged price either ? if you don ' t mind , please forward the data to me so that i can take a quick look at it .

for gbm , i was thinking about using crude volatility . unfortunately , supply and demand is not a good indicator of predicting prices because of the economic complexity of processing aromatics . statistically , there is no relationship between utilization , supply , demand and price . inserting time lag does not make the number any better either .

hi christian ,
both mean reversion and gbm models assume that all information related to a future price may be found in the historical price . the approach employed in the ag curves suggests that there may be some fundamental information related to supply and demand that impacts also drives future price . a portion of the mean reversion process is actually captured with inclusion of lagged prices ( autoregressive component ) . a gbm process requires some information on price volatility . since there is presumably no forward / future curve for the commodity of interest , it is difficult to come up with historical volatility values . hope it helps .

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

new facsimile machine information
please take a look @ the following and let me know , which fax machine you
choose or if you need information on something smaller , then i will have the
vendor contact you directly to finalise installation . an enron director or
above { with signature authority to legally bind enron to a contract } will
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be
installed . delivery times on new machines are normally 3 - 5 working days but
either vendor listed below will be able to provide a "" loaner "" should you have
a business need . please discuss the fax machine install date with the rep
when ordering the equipment .
if there is no existing fax line present , you will need to send a notes - mail
to the move team { erica @ x 3 - 3185 or janelle @ x 5 - 7917 } requesting the
installation of a new fax line . the move team can be found in the notes - mail
"" ect address book "" .

all the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33 . 6 kbps versus
the canon laserclass 7500 { example only } @ 14 . 4 kbps = new fax machine should

maintenance = models listed below have maintenance / repair coverage included
in monthly $ total . there is no separate agreement ! toner / drum cartridges +
paper + line charges are extra { not quoted }

vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various
models .
if the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment , here are some
considerations :
no more than 20 people per fax machine = take a look @ the fax machine
placement on eb 30 or eb 31 .
disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33 . 6 k modem and jbig
compression { or equivalent } .
look for memory upgrades & 2 nd paper tray included in monthly cost . { models
quoted are loaded } .
maintenance is to be included in monthly cost { models quoted are covered } .

subject : cairn gas purchase bid
bobby ,
after meeting with cairn today in delhi , my perception is that our offer was
received well . they were more open and relaxed then they were on wed .
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range , ( once we
talked through the price movements ) , and the seriousness of our gas related
activities on the west coast of india , in light of the ioc agreement . i
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections
were raised . we did talk to some extent about the guarantees , but we didn ' t
get too far and they ' re willing to accept at this point that what ' s
acceptable to the lng suppliers , should be suitable for their needs .
however , they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of
enron energy marketing a little better and i told them i would get back to
them on that point .
david and ajay were up in hazira yesterday looking at some property for their
gas treatment facility , which apparently is across the road from pipeline
access . while there they went and looked at shell ' s proposed lng site after
walking the last 1 km , inaccessible to their 4 wd vehicle and not surprisingly
found a beach .
in summary , here is what we offered on a non - binding basis :
six year production plateau
85 % top
$ 3 . 67 / mmbtu net , at a base of $ 18 / bbl brent , with point of sale at the
tail - end of the gas processing plant
floor & cap of $ 15 . 50 - $ 27 . 00 / bbl
price movement : + / - $ 1 . 00 / bbl from the $ 18 / bbl base price ( on a 3 mo .
rolling average ) equals + / - $ 0 . 145 / mmbtu fixed on a quarterly basis
guarantees : same protection we ' re providing the lng suppliers under the
trust retention account
i appreciate everyone ' s help in submitting this offer .

california update 3 / 26 / 01,"executive summary :
- cpuc likely to pass rate hikes tomorrow , politicians bowing to the inevitable
- many questions still unanswered , most notably size / structure of rate increase and past utility debts
- past undercollect major sticking point , with little help available from transmission deal or long - term contracts
- reliant seeking relief in circuit court from emergency orders ; large generators increasingly angry with davis ' "" blame game ""
- qfs waiting for details of rate hike ; new price formula crucial to socal ' s ability to make payments
- bankruptcy outlook increasingly complex , but debt rescheduling remains subject to failure
in our late friday report , we wrote "" davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort , but this action would not address the undercollection issue . there is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators , commercial paper holders , and ( less now but still very possible ) the qfs as time is running out . "" events are unfolding exactly along these lines .
1 . why rate hikes now ?
cpuc president lorretta lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes . davis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest solution , but that there is a potentially painful political price attached . davis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system , passing on most of the hikes to business and industrial users .
other california politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes . the calenergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors , who are now able to sell outside the state , if they can get similar relief from the courts . and it ' s not just the qfs - - the giant reliant energy is appealing to the ninth circuit court in san francisco against federal judge frank damrell ' s series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to california .
2 . what impact will the rate hikes have ?
rate rises will stabilize the situation going forward , but there will be a messy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts . some form of rescheduling is a possibility , but there are any number of accidents that could happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities - - if they don ' t seek protection from creditors themselves .
3 . undercollection / net short still unaddressed
all of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the bond revenue plan . still , the passage of rate hikes could speed up the legislature on these fronts as well . the bulk of the rate hikes will go first to repay the dwr , then to the commercial creditors . absent the transmission line deal , the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured to repay the past undercollect . long - term power contracts are still relatively meaningless until 2003 , when the majority of the contracts kick in .
4 . large power suppliers losing patience
relations are also deteriorating between davis and the large power suppliers . davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them during the drawn out negotiations , talking to several of the main ceos almost daily . but state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate investigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the growing political heat from themselves . this is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes . if reliant loses their case , it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy . what ' s more , financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience , and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy . pg and ( 2 ) many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any possible standing for future court action . it is in the interests of a number of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached , but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten to force bankruptcy .
other bullish news : pg & e gets extended forbearance until april 13 th from its banks , and socal announces that it will pay some qfs . the actual amount of payments to the qfs is still subject to the cpuc approving a revised pricing formula that is satisfactory to the qfs . that decision should come tomorrow .
6 . outlook
last week we wrote that "" the qfs felt there was no point in filing today because they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and in all likelihood , what they can get from the cpuc hearing next week . "" the next 48 hours will be crucial . only massive rate hikes ( 40 % or higher roughly ) would address the undercollect issue and davis is unlikely to authorize those .
as one source told us , "" the age of denial is ( mostly ) coming to an end , and that is the main source of hope that california can begin to move forward from this . "" but the situation is so complex , and there are so many players and angles involved , that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will still be complicated and vulnerable to failure .",0

is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee . i know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $ 10 mm to cancel the contracts ? if we could do we want to do this ?
how much money would we lose ( how much of a write down would we take ) if i told you i wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of september ?
as an aside , the mitsubishis will be leaving the enron americas balance sheet now and moving to egas . this does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward . for the company overall , we need to move these turbines ( as with all the others ) as soon as possible and we ( in the americas ) are in a much better position than egas is to move them . i have spoken to jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward .

how can you sell this software as oem ? it seems too good to be true - is there a catch ?
there is no catch - the software versions that we sell are oem ( original equipment manufacturer )
which means you will receive the installation cds only ( they do not come in their original retail
packing and do not include the manual ) . we do guarantee that all programs are the 100 % full working
retail versions - no demos or academic versions ! when you order , you will receive all materials
required for a complete installation - or your money back ! why pay hundreds of dollars more when you
can get exactly the same but oem - cd ? you don ' t have to pay that much for the fancy box and manuals .
why is your software so inexpensive compared to the other retailers ?
we minimize our overhead by stocking mostly top selling software only and try to get the
best deals for them . we also sell what are called oem versions , the same software as the
box version without the box and the manual . by foregoing the fancy box and typically slim
manuals you end up saving a considerable amount .

re : energy derivatives,"hi vince ,
hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next
week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out
some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! )
to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of
the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter ?
i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style .
many thanks and best regards .
chris .
2 overview of this book
this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book .
in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean
reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .
chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and
trade .
chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves . what we do in this chapter
chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors
and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or
average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .
chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form
solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps .
chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is
developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style
options .
chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a
multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are
developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo
schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of american style options .
chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .
in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also
discussed .
chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after
discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs
( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,
delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we
look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market
variables .
finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .",0

and gas , and therefore , rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the
comprehensive settlement . the cs was offered by socal gas and supported by
many of the settlement parties , including enron and transwestern .
the good news is that , with respect to hector road , the maximum volume at
hector is limited to 50 mmcf / d , similar to the proposal made by the
comprehensive settlement . i ' ve included the section from the pd that deals
with this issue for your convenience . the full document is also attached .
excerpt at at page 50 regarding hector road :
( 1 ) receipt points / intrastate transmission
as we have already discussed above , we now judge that intrastate transmission
unbundling is not wise at this time for the socalgas system . however ,
socalgas  , intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessible
and understandable to its users .
in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and
shippers with the lack of clarity on how socalgas schedules gas shipments
through its windowing system , and socalgas  , sole use of the hector road
interconnection as a receipt point . ( exh . 8 in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , pp . 29 - 31
( southern california edison company market conditions report ) , ( panel hearing
testimony of mr . paul carpenter , southern california edison , tr . pp .
931 - 932 , jan 25 , 1999 ) . ) our decision in d . 99 - 07 - 015 directed investigation
into using the hector road interconnection , even on an interim basis , and the
publication of socalgas  , windowing criteria in tariffs . socalgas filed
advice letter 2837 , which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount of
gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior day  , s
nominations , except at the first of the month . early in the instant
proceeding , the alj held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing
procedure tariff socalgas filed , pending the resolution we reach today .
( prehearing conference of september 1 , 1999 , p . 34 . )
we are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowing
process with a system under which socalgas will establish receipt point
capacities , subject to daily revision , on the basis of the physical maximums
for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day .
customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be
posted on socalgas  , gasselect system daily prior to the nomination
deadlines . if , in the aggregate , customers nominate more than the physical
capacity at any receipt point , gas will be scheduled based on the upstream
pipeline  , s capacity rights system . for wheeler ridge , at which more than one
upstream pipeline delivers gas , the maximum daily physical capacity would be
allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day  , s
scheduled deliveries from each source .
this system eliminates the mystery in how pro - rations are made , provides
continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems
and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most
cost - effective receipt point on any given day . we recognize that it does not
provide for long - term planning , but the alternative under the cs of paid - for
firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvantage
of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term .
in this period of gas price volatility , we believe that the more flexible
plan is the right one .
thus , we direct socalgas to withdraw advice letter 2837 and file a new advice
letter within 10 business days implementing the proposed receipt point
physical capacity system . this may be the same as the exemplary tariff filed
with the is or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings . this
tariff revision will be effective within 30 days after the filing unless
rejected by the energy division .
in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , pg & e and edison particularly complained about the
restrictions at wheeler ridge . ( exh . 15 in r . 98 - 01 - 11 , pp . 7 - 9 ( pg & e
rebuttal to market conditions report ) , and exh . 8 in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , pp . 29 - 31 ,
( southern california edison , market conditions report ) . ) one response in the
is to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at
hector road for all customers , subject to wheeler ridge access fees and
surcharges . its capacity will be 50 mmcfd or greater as long as there are
nominations of that volume and mojave pipeline company delivers that much in
response to those nominations . this provision should allow greater
flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing field
between socalgas and others at this interconnection . we will support
socalgas  , application to the federal energy regulatory commission for
approval of hector road as a formal delivery point by mojave .
el paso natural gas company objected strongly to the provision in the is for
automatically expanding of wheeler ridge capacity while this was not an
option specifically mentioned in d . 99 - 07 - 015 , we do not choose to stand on
that technicality to exclude it from consideration here . once a proceeding
is open to settlement , the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matters
outside the delineated scope , as they have done here with regard to wheeler
ridge expansion and , for instance , pooling . both proposals respond to
concerns raised in r . 98 - 01 - 011 , ( see citations in text above as well as panel
hearing testimony of mr . benjamin c . campbell , pg & e , tr . pp . 267 - 268 , jan 19 ,
1999 ) ) and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in
d . 99 - 07 - 015 . we therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding .
to the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained , we
welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding , as well as proposals
for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for . by 100 mmcfd
if a certain number of curtailments occurred , and for automatically allowing
the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates . we do not wish to
approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for which
only some may have use , but we believe that developing criteria for expansion
of receipt points is useful . hector road may not entirely alleviate the
problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south .
therefore , we approve that portion of section iii of the is that sets forth
criteria for expansion , but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria ,
socalgas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point
capacity . that application shall be processed in the regular way , with the
issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market
conditions considered . moreover , rolled - in or incremental rates , allocation
of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for
decision in that proceeding .
thus , the modification to the is that we make is in the first sentence of the
first full paragraph on page 8 . the words  & apply to  8 should be inserted
after  & socalgas will  8 . we specifically disapprove the is language in the
middle on page 8 beginning with the words  & this settlement  8 through the end
of the paragraph , and the concomitant language in appendix a setting the cost
at $ 12 million in 1999 dollars .

subject : bad proposed decision
well , this shows the direction in which the "" new "" commission is heading . the
very good news , though , is that tw ' s proposal was included in both
settlements ( now that ' s hedging ! ) . thus , the benefits to tw were preserved
under both proposals . congratulations . that ' s fantastic - - hard work that
paid off .
we will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the pd , and point
out that this decision condemns california to a 20 th century infrastructure ,
when the state ' s 21 st century economy demands much , much better .
we should discuss . since the pd empowers the likes of norm and florio , it
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of hector .
sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news . but we have a knack of
making lemonade out of lemons and we ' ll do out best to do the same here ,
whatever turns up at the end .
best ,
jeff

the pd in the gas restructuring is out . i have yet to read the whole
thing , but the title "" approval with modifications of the interim
settlement . . . "" does not bode well . according to steve watson ( and i only
have steve ' s statement second hand ) , the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market .

indicating heavy accumuiation of shares . this is a sign of even bigger
things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of
waste
materiais into electrica | energy , an industry with such high global
demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the
market .
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere
process system for the disposa | of a wide variety of waste products at
5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major impact on the globa | waste
probiem . this profitabie and environmentaily safe process converts into
clean ,
"" green "" electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricuitural wastes , forestry wastes , medica | wastes , industrial
wastes ,
sewage sludge , shaie oi | , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used
tires .
geec generates 5 to lo mega - watts per hour of eiectricity from the
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then soid to replenish
the
| oca | or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in fiiling an worldwide need for
cost - effective renewabie energy sources and a corresponding universa |
need to
solve critical probiems in the disposa | of waste . geec has secured
internationa | acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to
significantly impact the global waste problem whiie a major push for
generating
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due
to shortages and massive power failures .
geec just announced a lo biilion , 5 - year joint venture with chinese
government - operated companies , inciuding yanzhou coal mining ( nyse -
yzc ,

energy
generation , two critical areas for a country with a population
exceeding 1 . 3 biliion peopie . as china ' s rapid economic advance
continues , a
shortfall of 5 oo miilion kilowatts exists annua | | y , prompting periodic
blackouts in a | | chinese provinces . geec is in line to profit
substantialiy whiie providing reiief from unmanageabie municpal soiid
waste
disposa | and simultaneousiy helping china meet its energy needs .
the chairman of geec , former prime minister of ireiand dr . albert
reynolds , has secured a 2 bi | | ion lineofcredit for geec and opened
doors in
over a dozen countries through poiitical contacts at the highest leve | .
dr . reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding
geec into a position of woridwide acceptance by embracing a major
foothoid
on the gioba | waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate
electricity from aiternative sources . dr . reynolds , who has previously
been
nominated for a nobe | peace prize , has surrounded himself with a
prestigious group of the world ' s foremost professors and scientists .
their
coliective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles , journals , and books .
these
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces | eading geec
into the next era of gioba | waste removal and the continuous generation
of energy .
the forecast for geec is crysta | clear , and this is just the tip of the
iceberg for this emerging worldwide | eader where shares should be added
immediateiy to every portfoiio . we expect a continuous fiow of huge
news announcements whiie shares still represent an uncommon value for a
company of this caliber . look for the continuation of strong positive
deveiopments that wil | ignite geec , which earns our highest rating for
the
most expiosive gains on wal | street .

megan ,
the april and may nomination spreadsheets from producer services reflect that there were purchases from conoco on hpl . there are no references to any purchases from conoco on gepl . on june 6 , 2001 , tom acton edited deal ticket # 133304 to include gepl meter # ' s 27 - 002 - 08 and 27 - 003 - 08 . i have no idea why tom edited the deal ticket to include the gepl meters . tom is no longer at aep and i couldn ' t find any documentation to support the changes . please advise if you need additional information .

northern natural gas,"yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .
ken
dear ets colleague :
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

meeting with petronas,"rick ,
i was contacted by petronas who requested a meeting
with enron on risk management . i have met with them
a few years ago and they want to discuss with us
their progress implementing risk management practices .
can we arrange for them a standard presentation , like the one we have for
banks
( you or david port , bill bradford , research ) ?
unfortunately , they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
( given a very tight schedule ) . they want to visit on thursday , feb . 8 ,
at 10 a . m . i shall take them out to lunch after the meeting .
i shall also contact jeff shankman and john nowlan
to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them .

subject : online launch plan update
with the filing of the hart - scott - rodino application last week , it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows . note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift :
week of jan 28 :
we will distribute a packet to each of the originators / traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed password applications . the packets will contain :
key messages
frequently asked questions ( faqs )
top counterparty checklist
external customer cover letter
password application ( pa )
registration form
fax cover sheet for pa / registration
electronic trading agreement ( eta )
internal online marketing contact list
each person receiving a pack will contact the master users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the password application ( pa ) and electronic trading agreement ( eta ) . during this week , we will be working hard to get as many of the pa ' s returned as possible . once we have a signed pa , we can send the customer their new user id , which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site .
a splash page will be available at www . ubswenergy . com or via an automatic redirect from www . enrononline . com . this page will tell customers about the pending launch of www . ubswenergy . com and provide links to the pa and registration screens and also to the user admin screens , which will allow customer master users to start setting up their sub users .

kevin ,
if you guys had aerons ( mesh ) and / or vecta ( leather ) chairs , my group
typically will not be responsible for the replacement of those chairs as i ' m
not aware of who has taken the chairs or where they may have gone . my group
does not stock these chairs , therefore we order as requested by business
units and charge your co / rc . there will be two chairs delivered to the
locations mentioned below , however , they will not be the vecta or aeron
chairs .
you may want to contact enron security and maybe they can investigate further .
thanks ,

"re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225","i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

greetings in sincerity , i am former
mrs . fatima setia , now mrs . chritiana ahmed , a widow to late sheik
mohammed setia from sri lan ka , i am 74 years old , i am now a new christian
convert ,
this happened few days after the tsunami disaster across
the south east asian region on 26 th to 30 th december , which my family was
also a victim .
from all indications my condition is really deteriorating and it ' s quite
obvious that
i won ' t live more than two months according to my doctors . this is because
the injury
i substained and my high b . p level has gotten to a very bad stage .
my husband was buried alive in the devilish landslide right here in our
home .
we couldn ' t produce any child . my late husband was very wealthy and after
his
death , no body remains to inherit all his business and wealth . the doctor
has advised me
that i may not live for more than two months , so i now decided to divide
part of this wealth , to contribute to the victims of the landslide particularly
in sri lanka , indonesia , philippines ,
and thailand . this prompted me to look for a neutral and god fearing person
to handle this as my condition
will not permit me to do so . i avoided much familiarity for personal reasons .
i selected you aft er visiting the website and i prayed over it , i
am willing to donate the sum of $ 24 . 342 , 000 . 00 million euros to
you for this assignment provided you guarrantte me judicious use of the
fund for this purpose
. please i want you to note that , this
fund is lying in a security company in europe and upon my instruction , you
will file in an
application for the transfer of the money in your name .
lastly , i honestly pray that this money when transferred will be
used for the said purpose , because i have come to find out that wealth
acquisition without christ is vanity upon vanity . you use 10 % of the fund
for contigency .
remains bless .
please do contact my laywer his email address : george _ colstas @ ureach . com : name
george colstas ,
i await your urgent reply .
yours in charity

commoditylogic financial invoice exchange vl . 0,"the fix module vl . 0 is now operational and meets all the specifications as
shown in the frs . the team would be happy to show you a demo at your
convenience , perhaps early next week . we anticipate our back office using
fix in parallel with existing systems for december 2000 , and then using fix
"" under fire "" for january 2001 invoices .
the demo uses actual data from sempra , our largest volume natgas financial
counterparty . in about a minute , fix is able to compare enron data and
sempra data ( received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a
mini version of our deal database ) , immediately matching about 1450 of the
1500 deals . it then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the
primary match engine could not . this whole process , if it were purely
manual , would take more than a day . using excel spreadsheets ( and sort
functions ) , enron currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching sempra
invoices . fix allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes .
our next deliverable is the confirm central module vl . 0 , due 1 december . we
anticipate delivering it on time , as we have with fix .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 16 ( reuters ) - energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third - quarter results on monday and tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years .
technology bellwethers intel corp . and international business machines corp . , which reported sharply lower profits , did little to buck the downward trend .
firstenergy corp . , an owner of electric utilities in northern ohio and western pennsylvania , on tuesday reported a better - than - expected 18 percent increase in earnings , citing increased electricity sales and lower costs . mining company freeport - mcmoran copper & gold inc . reported a third - quarter profit that reversed a year - earlier loss , due to higher gold production .
yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule . top chipmaker intel said on tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales . pc maker ibm announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits .
energy giant enron corp . posted a quarterly loss after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges . companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls , including caterpillar inc . , the world ' s largest maker of construction equipment , and unisys corp . , a computer company .
"" the earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly , and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point , "" said michael holland , who runs the $ 65 million holland balanced fund .
focus not on earnings
"" the focus ( for investors ) has been and continues to be outside of earnings , that is , the war on terrorism specifically , "" he said .
dynegy inc . , a natural gas and power marketer and trader , on monday said third - quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns . while enron posted a loss , it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business .
"" energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down , "" said jon burnham , portfolio manager for the $ 170 million burnham fund . "" these are good , well - financed companies . ""
caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes . the peoria , illinois - based company on tuesday said its third - quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing .
the company also said it expects fourth - quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year - ago quarter , with full - year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent . it blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month ' s attacks for the expected shortfall , but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels .
unisys on monday reported its third - quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high - end server computers and systems integration work . it said it would cut 3 , 000 jobs and slashed its fourth - quarter outlook .
taking grim tidings in stride
other companies that have reported profit drops include novellus systems inc . , a maker of semiconductor production equipment , and charles schwab corp . , the top u . s . discount brokerage . schwab said tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer , although a surge in september trading pointed to better times ahead .

usa : energy permits some light in gloomy profit season .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 16 ( reuters ) - energy and mining companies provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third - quarter results on monday and tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years .
firstenergy corp . , an owner of electric utilities in northern ohio and western pennsylvania , on tuesday reported a better - than - expected 18 percent increase in earnings , citing increased electricity sales and lower costs . mining company freeport - mcmoran copper & gold inc . reported a third - quarter profit that reversed a year - earlier loss , due to higher gold production .
yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule . energy giant enron corp . . ene ) posted a quarterly loss after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges . companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls , including caterpillar inc . , the world ' s largest maker of construction equipment , and unisys corp . , a computer company .
"" the earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly , and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point , "" said michael holland , who runs the $ 65 million holland balanced fund .
"" the focus ( for investors ) has been and continues to be outside of earnings , that is , the war on terrorism specifically , "" he said .
investors are likely to pay attention to the earnings reports from tech bellwethers international business machines corp . , a computer maker , and chipmaker intel corp . . these are scheduled to be released on tuesday after the close of trading .
dynegy inc . , a natural gas and power marketer and trader , on monday said third - quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns . while enron posted a loss , it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business .
"" energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down , "" said jon burnham , portfolio manager for the $ 170 million burnham fund . "" these are good , well - financed companies . ""
caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes . the peoria , illinois - based company on tuesday said its third - quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing .
the company also said it expects fourth - quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year - ago quarter , with full - year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent . it blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month ' s attacks for the expected shortfall , but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels .
unisys on monday reported its third - quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high - end server computers and systems integration work . it said it would cut 3 , 000 jobs and slashed its fourth - quarter outlook .
other companies that have reported profit drops include novellus systems inc . , a maker of semiconductor production equipment , and charles schwab corp . , the top u . s . discount brokerage . schwab said tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer , although a surge in september trading pointed to better times ahead .
money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride .
"" most of these earnings situations are in these stocks , "" said burnham . "" barring unforeseens in the national and international situation , the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months . ""
"" whatever earnings are in this quarter isn ' t going to matter too much , except in cases where they ' re considerably better than expected or worse , "" he said .

usa : interview - enron says may partner or sell broadband business .
10 / 16 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , oct 16 ( reuters ) - energy giant enron corp . said on tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss - making broadband telecommunications business , which could involve selling the business or finding a partner .
"" in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities , "" chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview .
earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years .
future options for the broadband business include "" sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities "" he said .
"" we still think over time that it will be a valuable business , "" lay said , but for now the broadband market is in a "" total meltdown "" , he added .
enron ' s broadband unit , which owns an 18 , 000 mile network , posted a loss of $ 80 million for the third quarter , but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters .
enron launched its broadband business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential and has scaled down its operations .
enron ' s stock rose by 87 percent last year , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform .
but the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured , ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india .
enron shares on tuesday closed up 67 cents , or 2 . 02 percent , at $ 33 . 84 .

usa : update 6 - enron posts loss after taking $ 1 bln in charges .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , oct 16 ( reuters ) - enron corp . on tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments , including water and telecommunications services , which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses .
enron , north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power , said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company ' s stock lost two - thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company .
"" what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way , "" chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call .
lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm .
houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 .
the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm .
commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago .
"" they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting , they ' re a solid company , but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield , "" said meade .
enron ' s stock closed 67 cents higher at $ 33 . 84 on tuesday , but for the year it is down about 59 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index . spu ) , which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period .
ill - fated businesses
originally a natural gas pipeline operator , enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u . s . energy markets to become the nation ' s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity .
the company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring britain ' s wessex water and forming azurix , a unit which enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled .
enron helped set up new power co . and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $ 28 per share to less than $ 2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u . s . residential electricity markets .
enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential .
enron ' s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform .
but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured , skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india .
enron ' s third - quarter earnings before one - time charges rose to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , from $ 292 million , or 34 cents a share , meeting analysts ' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call .
the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for all of 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for all of 2002 .
debt on credit review
rating agency moody ' s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade . the writedowns would reduce enron ' s equity base , increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings , moody ' s said .
enron ' s third - quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division , the company ' s backbone moneymaker , grew 28 percent .
the division , which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas , saw pretax income rise to $ 754 million from $ 589 million in the third quarter of 2000 .
all of the income growth in the segment came from enron ' s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas , where income grew to $ 701 million from $ 536 million last year .
the european segment , which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals , coal and crude oil , remained flat at $ 53 million amid lower volatility .
the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations .
in doing so , lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling ' s departure : that he would make enron ' s financial reporting more transparent . many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron .

enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 )
2001 - 10 - 16 16 : 29 ( new york )
enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 )
( adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of enron ' s profits over the last four quarters . closes shares . )
houston , oct . 16 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest
energy trader , had a $ 618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales
cost the company $ 1 . 01 billion .
the loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends , enron said . net income a year earlier was $ 292 million ,
or 34 cents . revenue rose 59 percent to $ 47 . 6 billion .
investors have sent enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural - gas
pipelines . some investors praised kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman
and chief executive officer , for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses . others said they ' re not confident all the bad news
is out .
` ` what is disconcerting is that they didn ' t do this sooner , ' '
said donald coxe , manager of the $ 352 million harris insight
equity fund . ` ` if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen , it
doesn ' t mean there aren ' t more . ' '
investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the
past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo
in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas -
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said
he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t
confident enron was detailing all its problems .
failed businesses
the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are
equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters .
included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new
power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and
international business machines corp . new power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies .
the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit
that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as
well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be
more specific .
enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost
another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired
workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers .
the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its
water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron
said .
enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than
$ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill ,
lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other
significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' '
lay said .
excluding losses
minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43
cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson
financial / first call .
enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes
energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and
taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier .
shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock
had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 .
` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its
energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who
helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares .
enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 .
` ridiculous investments '
at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses .
enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water ,
from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in
1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north
american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million .
in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the
bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and
taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier .
revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million .
` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for
the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments . ' '
while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money . the company
gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including
coal , forest products and steel .
` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' '
hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and
clear , and that the effort is there . ' '",0

subject : visit to enron
hello vince ,
it was nice seeing you at stanford and many thanks for the lunch
we had together . i really enjoyed our discussions , both at the
technical level and otherwise .
i promised to send you an e - mail regarding possible dates for
a visit to enron . i delayed it for a week till my schedule was
clearer . let ' s see if we can get a match with your schedule -
mine is rather terrible :
friday , 21 st of april looks good . but april 23 rd is easter
sunday , so that may make it difficult for some people at enron
to be around . let me know if that is the case . i am willing to
visit then , because the week after that i am scheduled to be in
japan and in the previous weeks i am all committed on fridays .
friday , 19 th of may is the next possibility , but this probably
is too far out . the main problem is that i am operating within
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this
research . this window closes by the end of april , and it would be
important for the student support funds to be in place then , so
that i can make hard commitments to students and attract top
talent . i am already reviewing files of students who have
approached me for phd advising , and i am in a mode of doing "" soft
commitments to star - level students "" to get this research and its
potential on their radar screen . top students are highly sought
after by advisors and i want to be an early player in this
competition .
does my visit to enron have to happen before we can set up the
project and student support at stanford ? if so , doing it before the
end of april is important for getting top people . if the visit can
happen after we get the ball rolling , then we can schedule it in may .
i assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets
going . please let me know what you think .

after enron is registered ( i think it ' s a free registration ) , you provide
the following information to the enron official so he / she will send it to nsf .
nsf will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
( called fastlane ) . since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after oct . 1 , 2000 , this is the must .

subject : duke transaction
we have closed tonight the following transaction :
we sell to duke energy a series of 12 monthly options ( july 2001 to june 2002 ) , volume 10 mw , delivery southeast center of gravity ;
strike : r $ 140 / mwh for july to december 2001 , and r $ 120 / mwh for january to june 2002 ;
strike payable 5 th of month following month of delivery ;
the options are automatically exercised when and if mae ex - ante price is greater than strike ( duke has not the option not to exercice if mae is not settling ) ;
price per mwh : floor + upside
upside : 35 % of ( mae ex - ante price - floor )
payable by duke at the earliest of 1 ) mae invoicing date ( regardless of mae agent payment ) or 2 ) july 5 th , 2002 ;
we do not take mae credit risk , but only duke ' s ; duke takes mae credit risk ;
we receive a premium of r $ 5 million upfront .
as a result , the deal is atm against our power curve . however we know that we are in rationing at least until november of this year . as a result , the mae ex - ante price will be r $ 684 / mwh . if we take the most conservative scenario and assume that we collect upside in july 02 only , mtm is about us $ 6 million . the more rationing last , the higher in the money will the deal be ( of course , immediate settlement at mae at r $ 684 of all long position would take us otm , but we do not expect this to happen very soon ) .
i hope that this is clear . credit is on board , i ' m talking to martha stevens and her new boss stacy white to validate my assumption on the mtm .

employees ' retirement plan is a victim as enron tumbles

the rapid decline of the enron corporation has devastated its employees ' retirement plan , which was heavy with company stock , and has infuriated workers , who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunged .
through the 401 ( k ) retirement plan , employees chose to put much of their savings in enron shares , and the company made contributions in company stock as well . but around the time enron disclosed serious financial problems last month , the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrative change . for several weeks , as the stock lost much of its value , workers stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated . they were not allowed to switch investments at all - - even though the plan had far less risky choices .
the unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for enron ' s workers . at the end of last year , the 401 ( k ) plan had $ 2 . 1 billion in assets . more than half was invested in enron , an energy conglomerate . since then , the stock has lost 94 percent of its value .
at portland general electric , the oregon utility acquired by enron four years ago , some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars . the utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work through their problems .
' ' we had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $ 800 , 000 or $ 900 , 000 , ' ' said steve lacey , an emergency - repair dispatcher for portland general . ' ' it pretty much wiped out every employee ' s savings plan . ' '
' ' shortly after it was frozen , the articles started coming out about some of the questionable activities of enron , ' ' mr . lacey added . ' ' the stock took a tremendous drop , and we were pretty much helpless . ' '
the loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on one investment . stock plunges similar to enron ' s have also wiped out the retirement savings of many employees of the nortel networks corporation , lucent technologies inc . and global crossing ltd .
the loss by enron ' s workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits made by some senior enron executives , who sold stock during the last few years . enron ' s chairman , kenneth l . lay , made $ 20 . 7 million during the first seven months of 2001 by exercising stock options - - and more than $ 180 million by exercising options during the three prior years . last week , mr . lay agreed to forgo a $ 60 million severance package after enron traders and employees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed acquisition of the company by dynegy inc . while they were suffering .
enron - - which is already the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation of transactions among enron and partnerships headed by the company ' s former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , and a number of shareholders ' suits - - now has an additional legal problem .
on tuesday , steve w . berman , a lawyer from seattle who represented states against the tobacco industry , filed a lawsuit in federal district court in houston seeking class - action status on behalf of enron employees who lost money on the stock through their retirement plan . the lawsuit says that enron schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fiduciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests .
' ' they were promoting enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching employees ' contributions with enron stock , when they knew the stock was overvalued , and that ' s a breach of their fiduciary duties , ' ' mr . berman said in an interview yesterday .
what ' s more , he said , the assets were frozen on oct . 17 , with the stock at $ 32 . 20 , even though enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosures about the company ' s accounting practices . ' ' they knew the worst news was about to come out , but they froze the stock , ' ' he said .
enron closed yesterday at $ 5 . 01 .
the company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pending litigation . a spokeswoman , karen denne , said that the change in plan administrators had been in the works for a number of months and that she did not know the exact date the change was put into effect .
like many other big companies , enron made its contributions to the plan in company shares . but employees also chose to put much of their own contributions into the stock , lured by its stellar past performance . the company says that 89 percent of the enron stock in the plan wound up there because employees chose it , and 11 percent was the company ' s contribution .
' ' a lot of people believed in the stock , so it wasn ' t just the company match , ' ' said an employee at enron ' s headquarters in downtown houston . ' ' it was their own money , too . people are just shell - shocked . ' '
the stock ' s past performance had lured many workers . last year , as the stock soared , total assets in the 401 ( k ) plan rose more than 35 percent .
about 57 percent of enron ' s 21 , 000 employees participate in the 401 ( k ) plan . the company generally matches employee contributions at 50 cents on the dollar , up to 6 percent of their salary , with enron stock , which cannot be sold and put into another investment until the employee reaches age 50 . but ms . denne said workers otherwise ' ' have a range of options ' ' in which to invest their money .
gerry o ' connor , a senior consultant with the spectrem group , a consulting firm based in chicago , said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze assets when administrators were switched . ' ' if you don ' t , you can wind up with misallocated money , wrong statements , and all kinds of complicating factors , ' ' he said .
but a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many specialists in retirement planning . employees are taking ' ' a lot of risk , but they don ' t think of it as such , ' ' mr . o ' connor said .
' ' they say , ' you know , i work for this company , and we ' re doing great . ' ' '
in addition to the swoon in their 401 ( k ) plans , enron employees have watched the value of their stock options wither . enron gave a far larger percentage of employees options than most companies do , but now , with the fall in enron shares , nearly all of those options are worthless .
enron ' s tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its workers in oregon . about 95 percent of the 2 , 700 employees of portland general , which enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash , are invested in the 401 ( k ) plan , said scott simms , a spokesman .
the losses , he added , have hit everyone ' ' including officers all the way through to other staff . ' '
' ' it ' s certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and others haven ' t , ' ' he said . ' ' it was the same plan for everyone . ' '
in an interview with the oregonian in portland , peggy y . fowler , portland general ' s chief executive , said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincidence . ' ' the timing couldn ' t have been worse , ' ' she said .
' ' we refer to our retirement program as a three - legged stool - - social security , the company pension and the 401 ( k ) , ' ' ms . fowler said . ' ' one of the legs has been cut off . ' '

risks too great to let trader just die

officials of dynegy yesterday weighed whether to seek to renegotiate the terms of the company ' s agreement to acquire enron , its houston rival , while enron and its bankers sought to shore up its finances , executives close to the two companies said .
the discussions came as the stock and energy markets continued to register doubts about the financial stability of enron , the energy trading concern . enron ' s stock fell another 27 percent , even though the company won a three - week reprieve from its banks on a $ 690 million note that would have come due next tuesday if enron had been unable to come up with collateral .
an executive close to enron described the loan extension , by j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , as a band - aid , given the approach of thanksgiving . ' ' people are trying to take the time to come up with something for the intermediate term , ' ' the executive added .
the bankers also met with investors , including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies , which might inject up to $ 2 billion into enron under arrangements that would protect them from a further collapse in the company ' s stock , the executives said .
the new investments would be in enron ' s transwestern pipeline , which links natural gas fields in texas to the california market , they said . the deals would be structured like dynegy ' s agreement , as part of the merger , to infuse $ 1 . 5 billion into the enron subsidiary that owns the northern natural gas pipeline . that arrangement lets dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merger falls apart .
besides talking with other potential investors , j . p . morgan chase and citigroup agreed to terms that have each taking a $ 250 million equity stake in such a deal , the executives said . the bankers plan to meet with enron officials on monday to complete the transactions , they added .
karen denne , an enron spokeswoman , noted that the company had previously said it was seeking a further infusion of up to $ 1 billion in equity . ' ' we are not going to discuss the specifics of who we are talking to , ' ' she said .
though investors again manhandled the stock of enron , which is down 94 percent this year , the banks , dynegy and credit - rating agencies all sought to proceed delicately . executives explained that hasty moves could only deepen the crisis of confidence in enron , wiping out the energy trading operations that only months ago made it one of the nation ' s most admired and politically influential companies .
dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating the merger deal could damage confidence in enron among investors and other energy traders .
an executive close to dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally . nor , he added , was dynegy prepared to demand that enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed . but he indicated that the situation could change .
ms . denne , the enron spokeswoman , said that she was not aware of any attempts by dynegy to renegotiate the deal . dynegy issued a statement saying that its chief executive , chuck watson , was encouraged by the steps enron had taken with its bankers . mr . watson said the company was continuing its due diligence on the deal .
dynegy ' s shares , which rose as high as $ 46 . 94 in the days after the merger was announced , on nov . 9 , closed yesterday at $ 39 . 76 , down more than 4 percent for the second consecutive day .
enron was the most actively traded stock on the new york stock exchange , closing at $ 5 . 01 , down $ 1 . 98 . that means the premium that dynegy would be paying for enron has risen to 115 percent .
analysts following enron ' s debt said that bankers had little choice but to support the company , given that most of enron ' s bank debt is not secured . that means that if bankers pushed enron into bankruptcy , they would receive no better treatment than the holders of more than $ 6 billion in enron bonds and other debt .
enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure $ 9 . 15 billion in debt that will come due by the end of 2002 . ' ' if the dynegy deal closed , that would be the best thing for the banks , ' ' said one analyst following the debt .
james b . lee jr . , vice chairman of j . p . morgan chase , echoed that thought in a statement issued by enron . ' ' we believe the interests of chase and enron ' s other primary lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort , ' ' he said . ' ' we will work with enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy . ' ' along with citigroup , j . p . morgan chase is enron ' s lead bank , and it is also an adviser on the merger with dynegy .
another group with the power to push enron to the brink , the big credit - rating agencies , continued to step gingerly . the agencies have held enron ' s debt rating one step above ' ' junk ' ' status , knowing that downgrading it further would force the company to pay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt - - effectively rendering enron insolvent . one rating agency official said yesterday that such a move would roil the entire debt market , adding that it was ' ' patriotic ' ' to hold off .
still , one rating agency , fitch , put out a strongly worded commentary yesterday .
' ' if dynegy steps away entirely from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seems untenable , with a bankruptcy filing highly possible , ' ' wrote ralph pellecchia and glen grabelsky , the fitch analysts following enron . ' ' our present bbb - rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks , without which fitch would consider lowering the rating . ' '
analysts and energy executives said that enron ' s collapse - - though unthinkable just weeks ago - - would be unlikely to cause a meltdown in the nation ' s energy markets . while enron has been the nation ' s biggest trader of electric power and natural gas , many other companies - - including dynegy - - make markets in those commodities . analysts say the gradual unfolding of enron ' s financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind deals and limit their exposure to enron .
yet even one of enron ' s most stubborn supporters was forced to concede yesterday that his confidence had been shattered by the company ' s problems , including the rapid depletion of its cash reserves , restatements that erased $ 600 million in earnings and the surprise disclosure of the $ 690 million debt .
that fan , goldman , sachs & company ' s energy analyst , david fleischer , downgraded the shares to neutral . until yesterday , goldman had kept the stock on its recommended list .

enron ' s japan subsidiary reviewing its business

tokyo ( ap ) - the japanese subsidiary of enron corp . , the beleaguered u . s . energy trading company , is reviewing its business here and hopes to conclude its findings in the next few weeks , a company spokeswoman said thursday .
earlier this month , rival dynegy inc . said it plans to acquire enron . enron has begun an assessment of its global operations .
enron japan corp . , a wholly owned subsidiary of the houston - based company , began its own assessment about a week ago , said spokeswoman mika watanabe .
enron japan ' s business includes e power corp . , a venture set up in japan by enron and orix corp . , a leasing company , which had been studying possible electric power plants .
shares of enron plummeted another 28 percent wednesday even though it reached a critical agreement to extend a $ 690 million debt payment .
analysts continued to question , however , whether dynegy ' s planned $ 8 . 9 billion acquisition of its larger rival enron will survive , particularly as some traders are limiting business with enron because they don ' t know if more negative revelations are coming .
enron shares have plunged more than 90 percent over the past several months following the departure of the company ' s chief executive and an accounting controversy that eventually caused it to restate its earnings since 1997 , eliminating more than $ 580 million of reported income .
its latest round of woes started monday , after enron filed a document with the securities and exchange commission saying it would have to repay $ 690 million in debt by nov . 26 because of decreased credit ratings .
enron japan was established in april 2000 and employs about 60 people , and had hoped to eventually break into japan ' s power industry , which is gradually growing more open .

japan : shock waves from enron crisis felt in japan .
11 / 22 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
tokyo , nov 22 ( reuters ) - the shock waves from the crisis at enron corp are being felt in japan , where the stressed energy group has about 60 billion yen ( $ 486 . 9 million ) of bonds outstanding , money market dealers said on thursday .
dealers said most of enron ' s yen - denominated bonds are believed to be held by japanese investors .
in the u . s . bond market , enron ' s 6 . 4 percent dollar - denominated notes maturing in 2006 were selling at a deep discount of 62 cents on the dollar on wednesday .
the price of enron ' s yen bonds are also under pressure , but because the japanese market is far less liquid than the u . s . market it is virtually impossible to quote a price .
"" even if you want to sell them , there ' s no one is out there to buy , "" said a market source , who declined to be identified .
some investors holding enron ' s bonds put on brave face .
"" enron ' s core business is still doing fairly good . and we have bonds due next may . so we have concluded that there won ' t be grave concerns for its redemption , "" said yasushi inoue , manager at ufj partners asset management .
some in the market are concerned , however , that some money management funds ( mmfs ) have enron bonds in their portfolio .
mmfs , seen as an alternative to bank deposits , generally invest in safe assets in order to secure stable fixed income .
but because the bank of japan has been guiding short - term rates to near zero since last march , some funds are allocating money to riskier bonds , or commercial paper , to raise returns .
five mmfs run by four asset management companies hold enron bonds totaling about 38 . 5 billion yen nominal value .
default worry
should enron default on the yen bonds , the price of those mmfs would fall below their purchase price , meaning some funds would be unable to fully pay back the money entrusted to them .
although mmfs technically do not guarantee principle , they are widely regarded be almost as safe as deposits .
"" if the mmf prices fall below purchase price , investors may lose confidence in mmfs , which could trigger an exodus of funds out of mmfs , "" said the market source .
that would force fund managers of mmfs to sell a large part of assets in their funds , which could in turn push up short - term interest rates .
"" i could not rule out such possibility , "" said the source .
separately on thursday , enron said it was reviewing operations in japan , including an option to sell the business to a third party .
"" enron corp is reviewing its operations in japan . . . considering every possibility including retaining the operations or selling a part of it , "" a spokeswoman in tokyo said .
the company will likely finalise its plans within five or six weeks , she said .
enron gained its first foothold in japan in 1999 , when it established affiliate e power corp , hoping to benefit from japan ' s deregulation of the retail power market .
in april last year , it set up enron japan corp , which has so far introduced electricity trading and marketing and other financial instruments . the company has 70 employees in japan .
shares of enron closed down 28 . 33 percent at $ 5 . 01 on the new york stock exchange on wednesday . ( $ 1 = 123 . 22 yen ) .

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
london ( afx ) - at least four financial institutions are circling wessex water plc as possible bidders for the south - west of england water company that enron , the struggling us energy group , needs to sell , according to the financial times .

enron , which bought wessex in 1998 for 1 . 36 bln stg revealed on monday that it must repay 6 . 35 bln stg of debt by the end of next year .
the newspaper said a purchase is likely to be complicated .
enron - - subject of a 9 bln usd bid from dynegy , its smaller us energy rival - - could be faced with a charge of 650 mln usd if the combined value of azurix , which controls its water interests , falls to 1 . 95 bln usd or 25 pct below its book value , the newspaper said . ml / rn for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com

directors of enron , the us energy group with close ties to president bush , will spend today ' s thanksgiving holiday locked in emergency negotiations to save the company from collapse , after a 44 per cent plunge in its share price over two days .
investors were increasingly worried last night that rival dynegy ' s $ 8 . 9 billion ( pounds 6 billion ) all - stock rescue bid will fall apart over the holiday period . as part of the deal , chevrontexaco , which owns a quarter of dynegy , will inject $ 1 . 5 billion of emergency funding into enron .
enron , which has admitted to huge accounting errors amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry , said on monday that it could be forced to pay back $ 690 million of debt because of its deteriorating creditworthiness . in a crucial concession , that payment was yesterday delayed to mid - december . it will have to pay another $ 9 . 1 billion by the end of 2002 .
enron is being investigated by the sec for allegedly making complex investment deals that kept billions of dollars of debt off the company ' s books .

new york - - doubtful that the stock market ' s latest surge can be sustained indefinitely , investors secured profits for the second straight day wednesday , leaving prices moderately lower .
' ' it is a bit of recognition that the market may have moved too , too fast , ' ' said alan ackerman , executive vice president of fahnestock & co .

stocks retreated further from bull - market territory yesterday , as traders hesitated to hold big positions going into the thanksgiving holiday with worries about the short - term health of the economy and corporate earnings .
even a bullish economic report , which showed the number of americans lining up for first - time unemployment benefits was down for a fourth consecutive week , could not overcome fears that a recovery was still a way off .
' ' the market has been levitating - - you could pass a hoop over it and see there ' s not a lot of fundamental support , ' ' said jeffrey kleintop , chief investment strategist for pnc advisors , who said his firm had sold bonds but was holding cash instead of buying stocks .
' ' jobless claims were down , ' ' he said , ' ' and that ' s a good sign , but we ' re still a long way from seeing the bottom in earnings for corporations . ' '
indeed , analysts do not expect quarterly profits to start to increase again until at least the second quarter of next year , according to the market research firm thomson financial / first call .
amgen bolstered health shares after the company , a leader in biotechnology , said strong sales of new drugs would help earnings increase faster than analysts had expected . but big technology names like microsoft fell .
the dow jones industrial average dropped 66 . 70 points , or 0 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 834 . 68 , down for the second session after clambering into bull - market territory on monday . a bull market is defined as a gain of at least 20 percent from a recent low .

enron , the most - active stock on the new york stock exchange for a second consecutive session , tumbled $ 1 . 98 , to $ 5 . 01 , on worries the company may not stay afloat long enough to be rescued in a pending takeover by dynegy .
enron said it had won a three - week reprieve from its banks on a $ 690 million note and reaffirmed its agreement to be taken over by dynegy . but shares remained lower after the announcement .

officials of dynegy inc . on wednesday weighed whether to seek to renegotiate the terms of an agreement to acquire enron corp . , its houston rival , while enron and its bankers sought to shore up the energy trader ' s finances , executives close to the two firms said .
although enron said it secured the remaining $ 450 million of a new $ 1 billion credit line and pushed back the deadline for repaying a $ 690 million debt , its shares fell a further 28 percent , after falling 23 percent on tuesday .
"" if dynegy steps away entirely from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seems untenable , with a bankruptcy filing highly possible , "" rating agency fitch investors said .
ubs warburg analyst ron barone said "" bankruptcy would not be out of the question "" if the merger fell through or ran into obstacles .
"" we believe the odds of enron incurring a material adverse change on its operations is soaring , "" barone said in a research note , saying that dynegy may invoke clauses allowing it to walk away from or alter the terms of the $ 9 billion agreement .
in a statement , enron said it was in feverish talks with its other lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to the dynegy deal .
"" we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders , employees and lenders , "" enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said .
j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james lee said in the same statement that chase believes its interests and those of enron and its other primary lenders are aligned , and that the bank would "" develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy . ""
enron ' s shares fell $ 1 . 98 to close at $ 5 . 01 . it was the most actively traded issue on the new york stock exchange for a second day in a row .
the shares had dipped as low as $ 4 . 55 on wednesday , rebounding slightly after enron ' s announcement . accounting for stock splits , that is the lowest enron has traded since february 1989 .
dynegy shares were off $ 1 . 94 , or 4 . 65 percent , at $ 39 . 76 .
dynegy on board
dynegy chairman and ceo chuck watson said he is encouraged by the new loan and debt extension . watson said in a statement that dynegy was working to "" accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger . ""
watson said chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , reiterated its "" full confidence "" in dynegy ' s ability to complete the merger .
however , dynegy officials worried wednesday that even discussing the idea of renegotiating the merger agreement could damage confidence in enron among investors and other energy traders .
an executive close to dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally . nor , he added , was dynegy prepared to demand that enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed .
an enron spokeswoman said that she was not aware of any attempts by dynegy to renegotiate the deal .
privately , analysts were calling the odds of success lower since enron made a filing with the securities and exchange commission on monday alerting investors to its credit crunch .
monday ' s filing noted that enron ' s financial woes have led to a "" reduced level of transaction activity "" with the company by trading partners .
most analysts interviewed by reuters called the chances of the deal even , where earlier they had listed odds of success at 60 percent to 70 percent .
however , one analyst said he thought emotion was driving the current stock moves , and that it comes despite three powerful factors in favor of the deal .
"" the bottom line , enron needs this to happen , dynegy wants this to happen , and chevrontexaco is supportive of it happening , "" credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer said .
trading deals down
goldman sachs downgraded enron and dynegy to "" market perform , "" and took both off its recommended list . goldman said the cash infusion from dynegy - - $ 1 . 5 billion - - "" appears inadequate to restore the confidence of enron customers . ""
enron ' s trading partners said they were treading carefully .
"" we ' ve been scaling back for some time , but we ' re still dealing with enron . every day , our credit people are watching , "" said al butkus , a vice president with kansas city - based utilicorp united inc .
the trading business , enron ' s crown jewel and the part most coveted by dynegy , relies on volume for profitability , and enron has said it was possible that the lower volumes would hamper fourth - quarter earnings .
one indicator of enron ' s shape was the fact that its bonds are being quoted by price , like junk bonds , rather than by how much extra yield they carry over u . s . treasuries , like investment - grade bonds .
the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6 . 75 percent notes maturing in 2009 were respectively bid wednesday afternoon at 62 and 60 cents on the dollar , each down from the high 60 s on tuesday . their yields to maturity were a respective 19 and 16 percent . its 20 - year zero - coupon convertible bonds traded wednesday at just over 34 cents on the dollar , down from 38 cents on tuesday .

gone are the cheerleading stock analysts , who achieved celebrity by touting stocks while quietly collecting bonuses for helping the same companies distribute their shares .
the profit outlook for many american corporations is dismal , with or without accounting manipulations .
yet in recent days , a widely followed measure of stock values , the price / earnings ratio ( p / e ) of the benchmark standard 54 in the wall street journal and quicken . com , and 68 on the cnn / money web site .
by any definition , if a company ' s earnings per share decline and its stock price stays the same , the p / e will rise , falsely implying more optimism .
"" based on trailing earnings , the present elevated s & p 500 p / e ratio is mostly a function of the collapse in earnings rather than the appreciation in equity prices , "" wrote analyst joe liro in a report for stone & mccarthy research associates .
for example , the p / e of lisle - based tellabs was 35 on march 10 , 2000 , when the nasdaq market peaked . it was 35 on wednesday . but tellabs shares closed at $ 16 . 04 on wednesday , compared with $ 57 on march 10 , 2000 . earnings at tellabs have eroded .
a more subtle factor affecting the earnings denominator of the p / e calculation is the failure of accounting rules to reflect changing business conditions in the information age and the expansion of service businesses relative to manufacturers .
many service and information companies invest heavily in research and development and advertising as opposed to plants and equipment .
yet r & d and advertising must be deducted as they are incurred as an expense , resulting in lower profits ( and higher p / es ) compared with companies more reliant on plant and equipment investments that are depreciated over many years .
the numerator ( share price ) is also a moving target . stock prices stand more than 25 percent below last year ' s peak , based on the s caption : graphic : looking at valuations sources : dow jones & co . , bigcharts . com chicago tribune - see microfilm for complete graphic

companies & finance uk and ireland - institutions cast eyes over wessex water - water enron seeks sale .

at least four financial institutions are circling wessex water as possible bidders for the south - west of england water company that enron , the struggling us energy group , needs to sell .
enron , which bought wessex in 1998 for # 1 . 36 bn - then worth $ 2 . 2 bn - revealed on monday that it must repay $ 9 . 15 bn ( # 6 . 35 bn ) of debt by the end of next year .
royal bank of scotland , candover investments , westlb and barclays capital are understood to have expressed an interest in buying wessex , which provides water and sewage services to 2 . 4 m people .
nomura , the japanese investment bank , has previously expressed an interest in wessex .
a purchase is likely to be complicated . enron - subject of a $ 9 bn bid from dynegy , its smaller us energy rival - could be faced with a charge of $ 650 m if the combined value of azurix , which controls its water interests , falls to $ 1 . 95 bn or 25 per cent below its book value .
this is because of complex off - balance sheet debt and ownership structures of atlantic water trust and marlin trust .
wessex is the main asset of azurix of which enron owns a third directly and controls another third through its 50 per cent interest in atlantic water trust .
medium - sized water companies similar to wessex are trading on the london stock market at about 85 per cent of their regulated asset value , say brokers . this would indicate a possible price tag for the company of about # 1 bn , likely to be well below the threshold required by enron .
financial institutions have expressed a growing interest in refinancing uk water companies , largely by debt . revenues from water services are be securitised to repay loans .
a possible trade bidder for wessex has yet to emerge . however , centrica and enel , the italian group , both expressed an interest in buying southern water from scottish power .
the scotland - based energy group instead announced plans last week to raise # 1 . 9 bn from refinancing southern water through the bond market .
credit suisse first boston , which advised scottish power , said it expected other utilities to consider similar debt - financed schemes .
westlb earlier this year supported a heavily debt - financed # 106 m management buy - out at mid - kent water while royal bank of scotland worked on the securitisation of glas cymru , the co - operative welsh company that bought the principality ' s water company .
drummond capital , a subsidiary of royal bank of scotland , is backing a management buy - out of brockhampton , owner of portsmouth water , for # 71 m and assumption of # 6 m of net debt . www . ft . com / water .

enron shares fall again on doubts energy : a retreat by bankers or a credit downgrade could threaten dynegy merger and land firm in bankruptcy . stock tumbles to 12 - year low .

new york - - investors pounded shares of enron corp . to a 12 - year low wednesday amid mounting doubts about whether the houston - based energy - trading king can survive long enough to complete its announced takeover by cross - town rival dynegy inc .
enron shares plunged $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to close at $ 5 . 01 in new york stock exchange trading , its lowest level since april 1989 . enron , a wall street darling just months ago , is down 94 % year - to - date .
a minefield stands between enron and the merger , analysts said . almost any stumble - - a further downgrade by a credit rating agency , a retreat by enron ' s bankers or trading partners , another negative surprise about its financial condition - - could pitch it into bankruptcy .
still , the credit rating agencies held their fire wednesday , keeping enron ' s bonds one notch above "" junk , "" or sub - investment - grade , status .
enron also gained some breathing space from its lenders , announcing that a $ 690 - million note payment due tuesday had been postponed to mid - december .
"" i think they ' ll probably limp through [ to the merger ] , "" said analyst michael s . worms of gerard klauer mattison in new york . "" but it ' s a bad limp . ""
there were no major new disclosures to prompt wednesday ' s sell - off , but investors seemed to be afraid to hold enron stock over the thanksgiving weekend , traders said . the stock market is closed today and open friday for an abbreviated session - - traditionally the lightest trading day of the year .
enron shares plummeted 23 % on tuesday in reaction to a filing monday with the securities and exchange commission in which enron disclosed the $ 690 - million obligation . the disclosure was a surprise even to the credit rating agencies that have been in constant contact with enron executives since the company ' s finances began unraveling last month .
the rating agencies ' view is critical , because under some controversial enron deals that have come to light recently , a downgrade to junk level would be a "" trigger event "" requiring enron to immediately pay $ 3 . 9 billion to creditors , the company said in monday ' s sec filing .
such an event could instantly bankrupt the company , analysts said .
enron has been reeling since mid - october , when it began disclosing details of deals involving limited partnerships organized by current or former company executives . the partnerships ' purpose appears partly to have been to pump up enron ' s reported profit while concealing large amounts of debt it was incurring .
the sec has announced that it is investigating the situation .
in addition to announcing the delayed payment , enron said wednesday that it had tapped the remaining $ 450 million of a previously announced $ 1 - billion credit line from its chief lenders , j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc .
enron probably can restructure its debts and postpone most payments until may , analyst ronald m . barone of standard & poor ' s rating agency said wednesday . it is in the lenders ' interest to cooperate , as much of enron ' s debt is unsecured by hard assets , and the banks would stand to lose most of their principal in a bankruptcy , he said .
dynegy broke its recent silence wednesday by issuing a statement in which chairman and chief executive chuck watson said he was "" encouraged "" by the news of enron ' s agreements with its lenders .
dynegy is "" working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger , "" watson said , adding that oil giant chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 % of dynegy ' s stock , reiterated its support for the deal .
ratcheting up the pressure on enron , another credit rating agency , fitch inc . , issued a statement wednesday listing its own concerns . enron ' s energy trading partners seem to be demanding more cash collateral and reducing their exposure to enron , which calls into question the ongoing value of the company ' s core trading business , fitch said .
although dynegy has reiterated its intention to complete the merger , enron ' s problems make renegotiating the merger terms or canceling the deal a possibility , fitch said .
"" if dynegy steps away entirely from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seems untenable , with a bankruptcy filing highly possible , "" fitch said .
if the merger falls through , dynegy still will retain the right to purchase enron ' s northern natural gas co . pipeline system for $ 1 . 5 billion .
however , analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said he believes dynegy still is mainly interested in the trading franchise .
"" i don ' t think it ' s worth dynegy ' s while to go through all this pain if they just want to pick up assets [ such as the pipeline ] on the cheap , "" meade said .

front page - first section - enron granted breathing space - us energy group postpones $ 690 m in repayments as it fights for survival .
enron , the crisis - hit us energy trader , won a stay of execution from its lenders yesterday but remained on a knife edge as it struggled to restore the confidence of customers , bankers and investors .
the former stock market star said repayment of $ 690 m ( # 479 m ) of outstanding notes would be postponed from next tuesday to "" mid - december "" . the group also said it had finalised the remaining $ 450 m of a $ 1 bn credit line from jp morgan chase and salomon smith barney , part of citigroup .
enron ' s survival is crucial to the smooth functioning of the us energy market , which the group dominates . its failure would also have severe repercussions in the wider financial markets , where enron offsets much of the risk of energy price changes .
negotiations with lenders are set to continue through today ' s thanksgiving holiday , according to people close to the talks .
whether enron can survive depends on the commitment of dynegy , rival us energy group , to its $ 9 bn rescue takeover bid , announced two weeks ago . dynegy said yesterday it was "" encouraged "" that enron had progressed in boosting its liquidity and it was continuing the "" due diligence "" review of enron ' s operations .
some analysts believe enron will burn through its cash balances of $ 1 . 2 bn before the dynegy deal can be completed next year .
david fleischer of goldman sachs , one of the last remaining bulls on enron , downgraded the stock yesterday , pointing out that cash balances were inadequate to pay off debt obligations of $ 2 . 8 bn by the end of the year .
one person close to the talks with lenders said enron had a medium - term plan for restructuring $ 9 . 15 bn of debt due by the end of next year . jimmy lee , vice - chairman of jp morgan chase , said the bank would work to "" strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy "" .
in morning trading yesterday , enron ' s stock fell 33 per cent before it announced the extension of the $ 690 m repayment . the group ' s bonds had also fallen to levels that suggested enron faced bankruptcy .
by lunchtime in new york the stock had recovered slightly and was trading at $ 4 . 97 , 29 per cent lower on the day . the shares started the week at $ 9 , but a regulatory filing by enron on monday that detailed the extent of its debt prompted traders to limit exposure before thanksgiving .

tis the season to be thankful . it ' s just that it seems as if any column counting our blessings this thanksgiving day should start with , "" yes , but ""
what with airplanes being flown into buildings , thousands dead , a war in afghanistan that will no doubt spread to other places , anthrax in the mail , a recession looming , houston companies collapsing or being sold and jobs disappearing - - well , thankfulness is harder to come by .
the most , it seems , that can be said is , "" well , it could be worse . ""
i mean , enron could be being purchased by someone from out of town instead of by dynegy . this deal means that the great majority of those enron jobs may still be here .
or that while conoco is being bought by phillips petroleum - - never mind that "" merger of equals "" talk - - phillips has decided , for sound business reasons , to put the merged company headquarters here instead of bartlesville , okla . , where phillips is based now .
then there ' s the recession . may it be short . but if it isn ' t , we will survive . unfortunately , no one has really found a way to abolish the business cycle . it ' s a fixture of market economies . we ' ve been through this before , and if we live long enough we will go through it again .
some encouraging signs ?
in the past houston has done better in many of the national recessions simply because we were the place you had to come if you wanted to keep your car running and the electricity running through your air conditioner . however , as is usual in recessions , demand for energy drops and the price of oil and natural gas tend to follow .
that ' s bad for houstonians . but it ' s good for the national economy . lower energy prices usually result in higher overall economic activity . and besides , people aren ' t going to quit driving completely . ( he said hopefully . )
let ' s see . let ' s see . more encouraging signs . there must be some around here . somewhere .
ah , yes . the 2001 transamerica retirement survey finds half of all americans say they plan to save more money for their retirement than they did in the past . that ' s good news indeed , since nearly nine in 10 americans acknowledge they aren ' t saving enough to live comfortably after they quit work . of course prior polls found americans also vowing they were going to increase retirement savings . let ' s hope , as the disclaimers on the mutual funds say , that past performance is not indicative of future results .
good news / bad news : here ' s a press release from continental airlines saying for the first 15 days of november the airline filled 68 . 4 percent of its seats . that was only 1 . 8 points below the 70 . 2 percent load factor in the same period last year .
before we get euphoric , however , we have to remember that continental has cut 18 percent of its flights , resulting in a 15 . 8 percent decline from the number of seats available last year . and the passenger revenue per available seat declined 21 percent from the year before . still , that ' s a bump up from the 23 percent decline in october . and over the thanksgiving holiday continental expects the same full planes it had last year .
see , you can find those silver linings if you look hard enough . it ' s just that the storm clouds are rather heavy right now .
and speaking of travel , here ' s some classic good news / bad news from vacationstogo . com of houston . if you ' re not familiar with them , they sell last minute cruise vacations on the internet . last minute usually being 90 days or less before departure .
the web site says cruise lines are now selling cruises below their own costs , simply because it ' s still better than letting the ship leave with an empty cabin . that ' s bad news for the line but great news for those contemplating a vacation .
then there ' s the stock market . in the recent past it ' s been making mincemeat of my retirement savings and yours . it does seem to be creeping back a bit . three cheers . maybe four if the trend continues . historically , the stock market drops in advance of a recession and comes back before the good times return . perhaps the economic turnaround isn ' t that far away .
and finally , the best reason to give thanks is that i ' m around to write this and you to read it . it ' s the same reason why the aches and pains of old age can be welcome . it sure beats the alternative .

battered enron sags even more | doubts mount over fate of dynegy deal

houston - - shares of beleaguered enron corp . plummeted an additional 28 percent yesterday even though it reached a critical agreement to extend a $ 690 million debt payment .
analysts continued to question , however , whether dynegy inc . ' s planned $ 8 . 9 billion acquisition of its larger rival enron will go through , particularly as some traders are limiting business with enron because they don ' t know if more negative revelations are coming .
"" while it is unclear how much weaker the wholesale trading business profile is , it is likely that counterparties will continue to closely monitor and limit their exposure to enron , "" fitch inc . analyst ralph pellecchia said wednesday .
enron shares have plunged more than 90 percent over the past several months following the departure of the company ' s chief executive and an accounting controversy that eventually caused it to restate its earnings since 1997 , eliminating more than $ 580 million of reported income .
its latest round of woes started monday , after enron filed a document with the securities and exchange commission saying it would have to repay $ 690 million in debt by nov . 26 because of decreased credit ratings .
enron also acknowledged a "" reduced level of transaction activity "" with the company by trading partners .
shares fell 23 percent tuesday , then dropped an additional 32 percent in early trading yesterday after a report by goldman sachs & co . analyst david fleischer that questioned whether enron had enough cash to survive .
the filing "" raised new issues about liquidity and the ability of the company to even finance itself over the next several months , "" fleischer wrote .
fleischer said enron had burned through $ 2 . 5 billion from sept . 30 to nov . 16 and said its cash balance of $ 1 . 2 billion was inadequate to meet remaining debt obligations .
enron responded later in the day with a statement saying that it had received an extension on the debt payment until mid - december , and also was tapping an additional $ 450 million line of credit .
that news wasn ' t enough to help enron ' s sagging stock price . in trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange , its shares closed down $ 1 . 98 at $ 5 . 01 .
enron ' s all - time trading low is a split - adjusted $ 3 . 94 on oct . 27 , 1987 , according to the center for research in security prices at the university of chicago graduate school of business . the company traded at a 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 in february .
michelle foss , director of the energy institute at the university of houston , said enron ' s latest round of troubles had to raise concerns about whether the dynegy - enron deal can be arranged . "" it doesn ' t look like it ' s going to be able to happen , "" foss said yesterday . "" it did look like a decent idea when they proposed the merger , but today i ' m sure they ' ll look at it and see if they can salvage their attempt to buy enron . ""
dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson said in a statement he was "" encouraged "" by the news of enron ' s debt extension and its credit agreement , adding that dynegy was moving ahead with its acquisition .
but fitch ' s pellecchia said this week ' s events suggest that dynegy might renegotiate the deal . he also said that if dynegy steps away , bankruptcy is highly possible .
shares of dynegy closed yesterday at $ 39 . 76 , down $ 1 . 94 or 4 . 5 percent , on the nyse .
ubs warburg analyst ronald barone issued a report yesterday saying the signs of trader withdrawal were leading him to project that enron would lose 25 cents per share in operating costs for the fourth quarter - - a switch from his previous projection of a 25 - cent per - share gain .
"" this , combined with the virtual complete absence of visibility and continued breathtaking surprises in updated financial disclosures is causing us to implement even more conservative earnings and price target assumptions on the company , "" barone said .
raymond james & associates analyst jon kyle cartwright said dynegy likely still wants to buy enron .
"" it ' s too early to put a probability on a prediction that enron is imploding , "" he said . "" i would like to believe ( dynegy ) recognizes the enormous potential value of a healthy enron trading group and that it ' s not the type of asset you can acquire out of bankruptcy . ""
but he also acknowledged the problems enron faces .
"" if the trading operation actually collapses , enron becomes a trivial pursuit question . ""

prudential , pimco have owned falling enron bonds ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 22 02 : 19 ( new york )
prudential , pimco have owned falling enron bonds ( updatel )
( updates to add details of renegotiation of $ 690 million
payment and stock price in 14 th and 15 th paragraph . )
new york , nov . 22 ( bloomberg ) - - joseph portera says he
regretted owning enron corp . partnership bonds when he sold them
last month at a 10 percent loss of about 100 , 000 euros , or
$ 88 , 000 .
these days , the head of fixed income at mackay - shields
financial corp . counts himself among the lucky . if he ' d waited
until this week to sell , portera would have lost almost $ 400 , 000
on the bonds issued by enron ' s osprey trust .
` ` i was pretty glum when i sold , but i ' m happy now , ' ' said
portera , who sold the debt from the mainstay strategic income
fund . ` ` my job is portfolio manager , not becoming a member of a
creditors ' committee . ' '
many enron partnership bond investors may end up less
fortunate than portera . money managers , including prudential
insurance co . , pimco advisors holding lp and sunamerica life
insurance co . , a division of aig life insurance co . have held the
bonds this year .
prudential and sunamerica were among the biggest owners of a
$ 1 . 4 billion note issued by osprey trust that pays annual interest
of 8 . 31 percent and matures in 2003 . prudential owned 8 . 6 percent
of the notes and pimco owned 5 . 4 percent , according to bloomberg
data .
other owners have included aig , travelers insurance co . , a
division of citigroup inc . , and metlife inc . , according to
bloomberg data that includes filings between march and july .
spokesmen for prudential , pimco , sunamerica , aig , travelers
and metlife declined to comment on whether those companies have
sold osprey bonds .
enron ' s dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to
credit - rating cuts , a cash crunch , a federal investigation and an
83 % plunge in the company ' s share price since oct . 1 . the
partnerships are responsible for $ 3 . 9 billion of the $ 17 billion
in debt listed by enron on monday in its second financial
restatement this month .
falling bonds
enron , the largest energy trader , has agreed to be acquired
by smaller rival dynegy inc . in a transaction now valued at about
$ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt . dynegy plans to complete
the buyout by october , and enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules to survive .
enron ' s bonds tumbled this week , with most trading below 70
cents on the dollar yesterday , on concern the company ' s debts may
scuttle the dynegy acquisition . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent coupon notes
due in 2006 were bid at 80 cents on monday , dropped to 73 cents on
tuesday and were bid as low as 62 cents yesterday . enron ' s 6 . 95
percent bonds due in 2028 traded as low as 50 cents on the dollar
yesterday .
enron ' s bonds would likely rise to par , or $ 1 , if dynegy buys
enron . they could fall below 50 cents if the proposed deal
collapses , said shannon bass , who helps manage $ 50 billion at
pacific investment management co . based on those prices , investors
give the dynegy takeover no better than a 50 - 50 chance , bass said .
dynegy has said it will assume about $ 15 billion of enron
debt - - $ 13 billion of short and long - term liabilities such as
bonds and $ 2 billion of preferred shares .
the debts include $ 9 . 15 billion in loans , notes and bonds
that enron is obligated to repay or refinance before the end of
next year , according to the company ' s filings . with its credit
rating in jeopardy , enron can ' t refinance easily , calling into
question whether it will be able to pay its debts before the
dynegy purchase would be completed next year .
marlin and osprey
enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure the $ 9 . 15
billion in debt , and it plans to pay off some it with sales of
assets . enron corp . won a three - week reprieve from lenders
yesterday on a $ 690 million note that became due next week after a
rating downgrade .
shares of enron , the most - active u . s . stock , dropped $ 1 . 98 ,
or 28 percent , to $ 5 . 01 , its lowest close since april 1989 .
enron created partnerships , including the osprey and marlin
trusts , and used them to shift liabilities off its balance sheet .
the partnerships sold trust bonds and enron guaranteed them by
promising to issue millions of shares of stock to back any losses .
funds from the osprey and marlin bonds were transferred to
other enron affiliates to buy power plants , pay for a water
management business and make enron - approved investments , according
to bond prospectuses .
when portera sold enron partnership bonds last month , enron
had been buffeted by the resignation of jeff skilling as chief
executive , a third - quarter loss of $ 1 . 01 billion from failed
investments by partnerships and a securities and exchange
commission investigation into enron ' s finances .
` ` not enough money ' '
portera sold his bonds because of a ` ` put ' ' provision in
osprey notes that allows holders to sell the bonds back to enron
if the credit rating is cut to a junk grade by any of the three
major ratings companies , moody ' s investors service , standard &
poor ' s and fitch . fitch and s & p rate enron ' s senior debt at ` ` bbb -
, ' ' or one level above junk .
` ` if there was that downgrade , everybody would try to put the
bonds back and there just wouldn ' t be enough money to go around , ' '
portera said . typically , put provisions allow bondholders to sell
back bonds at their original price .
portera sold the osprey stake on oct . 24 at 89 cents on the
dollar after holding the bonds 13 months . the notes had traded at
96 cents on the dollar just days before portera sold . the notes
were bid at 56 cents this week .
when enron sold debt through osprey and marlin between
september 1999 and july 2001 , its credit rating was improving and
its bonds were trading near face value . the company likely planned
to sell new bonds to pay off partnership debt when it came due ,
said austin ramzy , director of fixed - income research at principal
capital income investors .
with enron now all but shut out of the capital markets , the
company ' s next option would be selling assets of the partnerships ,
which include power plants and water systems . the partnership debt
can be seen as only ` ` partially secured ' ' because the assets
wouldn ' t fetch enough to cover all the obligations , ramzy said .
` ` right now the exercise is to estimate how far short the
asset coverage is in these trusts , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an
analyst at creditsights inc . , a new york - based fixed - income
research firm .

subject : re : stanford project
nick ,
hope you had a nice christmas . best wishes for the new year .
it would certainly be great to see you and to meet eric some time in the next
few months . everyone here
was very impressed with giuseppe and we are eager to have another of your
students come to enron .
enron broadband is continuing to evolve and the current vision is to rely on
enron ' s trading expertise while trying to
minimize our role as an engineering company and innovator of technology . i
spoke recently with jim fallon , the current
head trader in ebs , and we put together a short list of topics of interest
where you might be able to help educate us .
i put these in the order of interest ( to mr . fallon ) .
1 . where will bandwidth prices go ? the direction of prices , obviously is
the concern of any trader . we realize that
technological innovation will continue to drive down prices , but are still
interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall ,
if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where you
could see prices stable or rising for some length of time ,
if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious
amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing ,
and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect on
prices of new technologies .
the term "" bandwidth "" might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity , but could
also incompass dark fiber , or ip transit and transport
pricing .
2 . during the last year , enron purchased a company known as "" warpspeed "" in
order to acquire their metarouter technology . to quote from the enron press
release :
"" metarouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the
optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in
the world . capable of processing thousands of connections per second ,
metarouter significantly enhances enron  , s ability to automate circuit
provisioning . ""
there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of
the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) ,
will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it
address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just
to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ?
the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter
technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will
need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are
implementing this technology .
3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas
such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what
value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of
stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to
ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail .
the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual
customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful
history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute
averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the
distribution of load looks like .
i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our
concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these
topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be
reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would
feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe
in the form of a talk here at enron .
again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again
soon .

subject : stanford project
hello vince and stinson ,
first of all ,
best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! !
if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together
some time to have dinner .
i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is
eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial !
we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would
hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into
the "" problem / opportunity generation environment . "" that really helps the
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research .
perhaps , our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter ,
say in march or so , to discuss the research issues we are pursuing . and of
course
you could visit us before that too .
with my warmest wishes ,

playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6

the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military

* * * oxygen , vital for life * * *
some things to consider :
oxygen is critical for life :
27 % increase in revenues !
the body ' s need for oxygen makes it the most important
supplement available . we simply cannot live without oxygen .
oxygen is the source of life to all cells
- dr . stephan levine , ph . d . molecular biologist and
geneticist
current lifestyles rob oxygen from our bodies :
our bodies now receive less oxygen from the foods we eat and
the water we drink than ever before . causes include :
- over - processed and fast foods
- overworked farmlands stripped of their nutrients
- significant increases in daily stress
- unbalanced diets
- lack of exercise and proper rest
rubble , garbage , toxins , refuse debris and anything
useless are destroyed by oxygen and carried out of the system . just as a clean
house holds little interest in passing flies , likewise an oxygen rich body is a
difficult fortress to assail .
brian goulet , certified herbalist canadian journal of health nutrition

ferc denied rehearing of a june order that permits arizona public service co . to assign its full - requirements ( fr ) capacity contract on el paso natural gas to affiliate pinnacle west energy to serve a new gas - fired generation facility that it is building in arizona . on the surface , it seemed a clear victory for the companies involved . however , chairman pat wood made it very clear that he has concerns about fr service on el paso , which entitles customers to unlimited capacity at frozen rates , and that he plans to take up the issue at a later date .
"" i will reluctantly go along with the order denying rehearing , but [ i ] look forward very aggressively to a forum in which we can address the capacity concerns "" on el paso , wood said wednesday during a marathon commission meeting , the first over which he presided [ cpol - 90 , rpo 0 - 336 ] . the proper forum for discussion of the fr service will be el paso ' s order 637 proceeding , he noted .
as a lawyer , "" it ' s hard for me . . . to find an excuse to grant rehearing here . because this is not the appropriate docket to do that , i will concede that after four months of being browbeat into submission . . . that sometimes you ought to fold up , "" wood said . "" but i remain concerned about the [ interplay ] on the pipeline that if we don ' t engage in some long - term planning , "" the situation could "" lead to a bedsore for the customers out there in the southwest . ""
the new chairman made clear that he was not "" a fan or supporter of 10 - year rate freezes or any extended rate freezes "" that are made available to certain fr customers . "" i understand that there ' s a tremendous disincentive here because of that for needed expansions to occur , "" wood noted .
he openly invited parties to challenge at the commission the limits of fr service . he noted that fr customers "" seem to have an unbounded upper - end , which i would love the opportunity to [ address ] if we ever get a contested pleading to define exactly just how full full - requirements can be . ""
the "" interplay "" of frozen rates and unlimited access to pipeline capacity in a "" growth part of the country that needs to have generation [ makes for ] a very complicated pipeline scenario , "" wood said .
in the june order , ferc gave the go - ahead for el paso to construct and operate two delivery points and about six miles of lateral pipeline to provide service to the proposed gas - fired electric generation facilities of pinnacle west and duke energy maricopa llc in maricopa county , az . pinnacle ' s 2 , 120 mw redhawk power plant will require about 410 mmcf / d of gas , while duke ' s 1 , 000 mw arlington valley plant will burn 210 mmcf / d . both plants have scheduled in - service dates of june 1 , 2002 .
major producers and other el paso shippers attacked el paso ' s plan to provide fr service of 410 mmcf / d to the redhawk plant , arguing that the service would further constrain an already capacity - tight el paso system . specifically , they objected to el paso ' s plan to assign the fr contract ( 66 , 042 mmbtu / d ) of arizona public service to affiliate pinnacle west energy , as well as give a "" huge increase "" in the contract amount in order to serve the redhawk plant . the protestors further argued that the plan would give pinnacle west energy a competitive rate advantage over existing contract - demand customers on the pipeline .",0
gtc vs . master,"louise ,
the consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the power guys would like to have a full blown master agreement on enrononline instead of a simpler gtc .
obviously , i can put either onto enrononline , but wanted to let you know before we do so .
if you want us to stick with a simple gtc , please let me know .

vince and vasant :,"here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at
the east desk , related to gas transmission :
typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example
might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay
$ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed
payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( "" shrinkage "" ) and 6 . 5 % for
overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( "" basis "" ) , and might call brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is
$ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow .
as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity .
also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
( "" it ' s not worth their time to haggle "" ) ( there is a further issue of
"" secondary markets "" not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and
brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take
( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline ,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts .

we have this issue in every deal we do , the benefit coverage is good
overall , but employees pay more for the coverage . it ' s income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits . benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
citigroup and we don ' t want to do anything with subsidy or anything else .
happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp . and ben . philosphy to
deal with the benefits .

john ,
i am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs . perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem . my
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical / dental premiums .

subject : re : approval procedure for pending products >
we are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products , the scheduled process will therefore re - create these products every day automatically ( essentially just a change to the description ) . therefore the product will already be there . in the mean time , all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue - we currently have most desks creating products weeks / months in advance . this software change is scheduled for friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month ( february ) .
we have only 2 logged / taped phone calls to the helpdesk when portland office has called the helpdesk with regard to this issue . clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap , but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo . dale does come in early specifically for any products portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times ( bad traffic ) when he may be late .
14 / 1 07 : 35 ( cst ) j richter called to approve products
products activated products within 2 minutes .
24 / 1 07 : 34 ( cst ) j richter called to approve products
07 : 45 ( cst ) anna gardiner approved products
07 : 46 ( cst ) j richter called to inquire on status
07 : 48 ( cst ) helpdesk rang j richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems
clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but enrononline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone . we only seem to have 2 times that the procedure has been used to the helpdesk extent and not failed dramatically .
changing the procedure for two days ( assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods ) when we are all working to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems . if we do not introduce this software change on friday we should review this policy - i obviously have no problem with tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway .

subject : approval procedure for pending products
i would like to talk with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products . it is not working ! the current procedure is for us to create the product and call dale neuner and let him know its out there . if dale is not in the office , or it is before or after normal work hours , the traders need to call the help desk , who in turn calls amita in the london office who then approves the product . the portland office starts trading at 5 : 00 am ppt . in the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning . this morning the traders had several daily products pending approval . it took 45 minutes to get those products approved . on daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour . as a result , the trader missed most of the trading period . our customers are not happy and neither are the traders .
a solution was proposed in december , which i have attached below , to address this issue . however , it only works in the ideal world . it would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time . that is not the reality . by rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade .
i would like to propose an alternate solution . we need a direct method for tim belden to have approval rights to approve existing products . these are not new products , we trade them every day . there is no reason tim should not have a level of approval to , at the very least approve existing products . especially where the only change is the term .
please call tim belden at 503 - 464 - 3820 or myself at 503 - 464 - 3836 . look forward to hearing from you .

mike -
regarding our conversation re : support of power trading , we propose the following :
1 ) suggest to trading that they create all draft products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day . i will always check for draft products at the end of my day and activate any that are in draft . just fyi , gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days ( or weeks ) in advance . i keep track of those and keep their products current in advance . it works very well .
2 ) i am usually at my desk no later than 7 : 30 a . m . each day . if trading creates a draft product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the call center at 3 - 4357 and state the following :
this is portland power trading and i need a product activated asap . please contact amita gosalia in london .
the call center will then contact amita , who has the authority and responsibility for activating products . amita has agreed to perform this function for portland power and will instruct her people at pcg - london to locate her immediately ( in the event that she is away from her desk ) when this message comes in from the call center .
donna greif in the call center has been appraised of this procedure and will roll it out to the responsible call center personnel .
i hope this solves the problem . please feel free to offer any comments or call if any part of this process is unclear .

energy book,"hi grant ,
hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail
that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel -
i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has
cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day .
i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is
there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was
wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some
sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my
request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the
book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter ?
i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed
slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .
many thanks and best regards .
chris .
2 overview of this book
this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book .
in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean
reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .
chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and
trade .
chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves . what we do in this chapter
chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors
and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or
average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .
chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form
solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps .
chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is
developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style
options .
chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a
multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are
developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo
schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of american style options .
chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .
in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also
discussed .
chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after
discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs
( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,
delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we
look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market
variables .",0

thanks for that . i hope you had a good holiday - we were all very jealous of
you at dinner the other evening .
i made some changes for it to fit in with our notation , etc , but apart from
that its a fin piece of work . if you could just answer the questions posed
by vince , and send me the final figure then we are a go ( all of ours are now
finished ) . would you be happy with the following ?
3 . 5 summary
in this chapter we have discussed volatility modelling and estimation in the
energy commodity markets , emphasising the difference between this market and
financial markets . we discuss the estimation of volatility from both
historical and implied data , again from the perspective of the energy user .
we further discussed a number of stochastic volatility models and have shown
how to estimate the models via ordinary least squares and maximum
likelihood . we have tested our estimation techniques on a number of
examples drawn from energy markets including electricity , gas and crude oil .
best regards .

rac organization changes,"the continued growth of the enron europe office and related businesses has
prompted a change in the management of risk assessment and control ( rac ) in
london . effective in early january , 2001 , ted murphy will transfer to the
london office and manage the rac activities which includes credit / market risk
and underwriting . ted will continue to manage the enron global market risk
activities . steve young , currently managing rac in london , will begin a new
assignment within ebs , also in london .
the houston market risk group will be managed by david port .
as enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses , it
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent
and accurate manner across the company . hopefully this realignment will
accomplish that goal .
please join me in congratulating ted , david and steve on their new

[ dcms - dev ] my inheritance,"date : may 16 , 2002 .
email : edum @ hkem . com .
dear sir ,
i am mr . eduado de mello , one of the principal
commanders of the union for the total independence of
angola , unita . well needless telling a very long story
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the
history of the world and the liberation struggle in
the southern african region of the african continent .
the bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme
commander , the late dr . jonas savimbi was killed in an
encounter with the government forces of the mpla
government of my country . the rest is now history but
suffice it to say that i am tired of the unfortunate
role of waging a war against my fatherland . i have
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life
and i have decided to make south africa my new home at
least for the interim period until i am sufficiently
sure that i would be welcome home whole heartedly by
the mpla government in luanda the capital of angola .
needles to say i was the single most important
commander who was very close to the late supreme
commander ; dr . jonas savimbi . indeed because i am a
brother to one of his wives , he confided in me a great
deal . the result of such trust is my reason for
contacting you i was the commander whom he sent to
deposit the sum of thirty two million usd ( $ 32 million )
with a security / finance company in south africa . this
was immediately after the events of september 11 , 2001
in the united states of america . indeed it had become
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money
around the world particularly for a liberation
movement like unita hence the recourse to keeping the
money with the security company in south africa . i
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out
and deposited with the said security / finance company
as cash in hundred dollar denominations . the money is
kept in my signature and would have been used in the
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of
continuing the civil war in angola . the supreme
commander is dead and as already stated i have decided
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue !
i want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit
the $ 32 million . i am still in the bush here but i have
been able to establish contact with the company in
south africa to the effect that i would soon come to
take possession of the money that i kept with them .
note also that i deposited the money as a foreign
national who is the head of a mining company in angola
( never as a commander of unita ) . if you are able to
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20 %
of the $ 32 million . please come back to me through
email : edum @ hkem . com . the security / finance
company is standing by to receive my instructions on
this and i will link you up with them as soon as you
are ready to take possession of the $ 32 million .
finally you are to note that in you reply , you are to
state your residential or company address and if
possible send a copy of your international passport so
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands .
yours truly ,
eduado de mello

marketing issues,"louise ,
1 ) i just received a call from pat o ' donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from ubs corporate marketing folks , instructing us not to use the url : www . ubswenergy . com . it seems they want us to use www . ubswarburg . com / energy . pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy . com tomorrow . he anticipates having resolution by noon . i personally don ' t care much what url we use : the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important . of course , a change in url now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again . . .
2 ) ubs ( in the form of matt meinel , who feels mike hutchins will be in agreement with him ) do not want us to redirect traffic from www . enrononline . com to the new site , as they feel that promotes too much of an association with enron . i disagree with their position , but don ' t think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name . also , the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement .
please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed . we are ready to put the splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow , but these 11 th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and i feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name .

re : project triple lutz,"all fixed priced deals ( esp . calpine ) have their risk assigned to the price
book . dutch quigley confirmed that these deals were more than likely hedged
( although it is difficult to hedge 20 year deals since we are one of the few
playing out that far ) . if we are under the assumption that we will be able
to transfer all hedges along with the deal ( s ) , then these deals are not
underwater . however , there will be some costs associated with transferring
the hedges . when i get a better idea of these costs i will relay them to

to date , my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the
contracts , and their unwind costs in our risk books . i have also been
involved with the entex contract valuation . dave baumbach has been the real
key to providing the data , and has all of the information . steve jackson is
talking with ed mcmichael of structuring on monday to get some additional
eyes and resources looking at this also . i feel we have done a thorough job ,
but we do need everyone thinking of "" what if ' s . "" our risk books are complex ,
with many hand - offs internally . obviously our goal is to ensure that all of
the stones have been turned , and there are no surprises at the end of the
day . i think structuring will really be helpful in this arena . after our
meeting yesterday , i believe everyone is much more comfortable in our
approach . there were a couple of things that dave was going to follow - up on
( fixed - price deals , especially calpine ) .

available , and will have the triple lutz data with me . if any issues come up

"re : biz , the momentum investor report","domingo hurst ,
sequoia interests
trading symbol sqnc pk
what if a company had a product that would allow oil wells to
produce much more oil ?
what would that stock be worth with todays oil prices close to 50
usd per barrel ?
10 , 20 , 30 , 100 usd ? and now several of the major oil companies are
currently testing the product .
at 0 . 50 we think sqnc is a homerun .
to solve this problem , the oil industry is looking for new
alternatives for increased exploration and production . the clear
solution for increased demand and consumption can already be found
in the ground , with nearly two thirds of oil left in the ground at
us wells , too technically complex or expensive to extract with
traditional technologies . enhanced oil recovery , eor , is an exciting
new frontier in the oil and gas industry which you are going to hear
more of in the coming years . sqncs innovative new product ,
diamondflo , could be at the forefront of this frontier .
sqnc has strong interest from major oil and gas companies for
testing and potential licensing of this product , and is in the final
stages of the research and development of diamondflo . with testing
expected to be completed in the next 60 to 90 days , and planned
patent application shortly thereafter , announcements from sqnc could
cause price gains for this stock over the coming months . what is
more , diamondflos unique chemical properties , make it an ideal
solution for a number of other application in the oil and gas
industry , including remediation and environmental cleanup of oil
fields , refineries , and storage facilities ; an estimated 8 . 1 billion
market . with this revolutionary product in the development pipeline ,
sqnc has also made some aggressive moves into oil and gas production
with its recent acquisition of leases in pecos valley , texas . these
operations will act as a testbed for development and validation of
the diamondflo product and could provide an additional revenue
stream and source of cash flow for sqnc .
with the commercialization of its diamondflo product looming near ,
we feel that it is only a matter of time before wall street
recognizes this stock . what is more , sqnc is positioned within an
industry that has seen tremendous upside growth , and is headed for
even more appreciation as the global oil crisis demands new
production solutions . over the last twelve months , the oil well
services and equipment industry has seen an average price gain of
more than 88 percent , and savvy investors in emerging companies have
witnessed tremendous profits . we believe that sqnc is one of the
most revolutionary new companies on the market . with major
announcements stemming from the completion of r and d on diamondflo ,
do you think sqnc could make a nice move in the coming day ? .
a few reasons to own sqnc .
1 . with its innovative diamondflo product , sqnc is positioned to
help alleviate the impending oil and gas crisis , with producers
struggling to keep up with growing us energy demands , as foreign
exploration and production comes under increasing geopolitical
pressures . increased consumption demands have combined with an
increasingly unstable international production climate to create
some of the highest prices seen at the pump since the 1970 s oil
embargo , and crude oil prices on the spot market have recently
approached the 50 usd mark . as oil companies seek new ways to
maximize domestic oil recovery , the chemical eor approach of sqnc
will be a major factor in increasing production and removing
dependence on foreign oil .
2 . enhanced oil recovery , eor , represents the logical next step in
expanding domestic oil production , and represents a tremendous and
presently underappreciated market potential . over two thirds of oil
in us reservoirs is left unproduced after primary and secondary
production , leaving an incredible and untapped source for us energy
needs . according to the us department of energy , eor has the
potential to recover 35 billion barrels of oil , 50 percent more than
the current us proven reserves of 23 billion barrels , and even
greater than the us estimated undiscovered potential of 30 billion
barrels . with its diamondflo chemical eor solution , sqnc could be
ideally positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on production
from these untapped oil reserves .
3 . sqnc has developed a revolutionary chemical eor product ,
diamondflo which offers tremendous advantages over thermal and gas
eor methods . thermal and gas , primarily co 2 injection to stimulate
production are costly and require a complex infrastructure , while
other chemical eor products have had limited success and are
environmentally damaging . by contrast , diamondflo is expected to
generate recovery of 20 to 40 percent above current methods , is
environmentally safe and meets strict regulatory standards for oil
recovery and remediation , and will be available to producers at a
comparable price point to competitive products . with introduction of
diamondflo to the market following completion of testing and
development , sqnc could revolutionize the oil and gas industry with
this innovative approach to enhanced oil recovery .
4 . in addition to its principal application in eor , sqncs diamondflo
product has additional applications in the 8 . 1 billion oil and gas
remediation market . during the testing process , diamondflo has
demonstrated exceptional remediation properties , with static
remediation tests determining that it removed more than 80 percent
of hydrocarbons from soil with no significant hydrocarbon emulsion ,
mixing of oil and water . this discovery paves the way for eventual
application in environmental cleanup of oil facilities or spills ,
and opens up a tremendous new market for sqnc . since 1992 , the
american petroleum industry estimates that over 90 billion has been
spent by the oil and gas industry to protect the environment , with
8 . 1 billion spent annually in environmental expenditures .

reminders
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you
will better help you in representing them .
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
everyone else in their peer group .
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .
let me know if you have any questions .

f / up,"sheila ,
i am forwarding you a message i received a few days ago . i want to ask you
for advice how to handle this case .
my first reaction was to ignore it . the longer i think about it , the more
convinced i become that some action
is required .
let ' s try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a
female employee
was harassed by a male colleague . an employee informs her boss a few months
later about
the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it . in many similar
cases , courts subsequently
found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such
complaints .
the fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is
immaterial .
if i ignore this complaint i may expose the company to charges of double
standard in
handling sexual harassment cases .
my recommendation would be to ask maureen to attend sensitivity training and
sexual harassment prevention class .
please , let me know what you think . sorry to burden you with this case .

i got your message ( i was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the
weather satellite dish - what a gorgeous view of houston ! ) .
i appreciate your words . everything remains fine , vince . you are my "" father ""
here at enron , and i admire and respect you greatly . i think i know the kind
of person you are , in terms of your integrity , and i admire the high
standards you set for all of us in your extended "" group . ""
i want to let you know i am not the only one in the group who doesn ' t
appreciate the way maureen disrespects you . you remain the key external
factor in their success - it is not simply their own abilities that matter to
their futures but your own - vince ' s - success with upper management that
matters .
we respect you , and we don ' t like it when you are disrespected . maureen
didn ' t disrespect me today , vince , she disrespected you .
it ' s time i told you something . last april , maureen , highly intoxicated
following a work - related function at ninfa ' s , made an unsolicited predatory
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19 th floor . i was shocked and
disgusted , but i didn ' t say one word about this , vince , because i played it
out and didn ' t want to put you into the position of having a raving maureen
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of
gender - bias crap lawsuits .
i "" took one for the team , "" vince . i can ' rt say i would do it again - maureen
is brazen to berate me after what she did , in public no less .
i appreciate your bringing me into enron . i ' ve found a respectful and ,
indeed , a loving work environment . i remain willing to do whatever i can to
help the group .

traders daily report,"best stoc - k for year 2005 - read the story and you will see for yourself
are you tired of public companies without anything substantial backing their story - how about a revolutionary invention that will change the security industry forever , and the company just went public ! ! !
company name : sniffex inc
ticker : snfx
we profiled this stoc - k 1 month ago when it was at $ 1 and we said dont buy unless you are long term player , we projected $ 5 - 10 should be seen soon and since then the stoc - k went to $ 3 . 4 high and is now steadily trading like $ 500 k or more every day at $ 2 . 80 range .
the company has the most sensitive explosive detection device in the world and now after what happened in london 10 days ago this sector is the hottest on the stoc - k market .
we believe sniffex will start selling their devices very soon to all security forces around the world simply because their device can find even 100 grams of almost any type of explosive from 30 - 50 yards maybe even more and even through walls or metal shield .
we strongly believe once everybody on the stoc - k market realize what a gem snfx then its possible for this stoc - k to see $ 10 - 20 levels .
rating : strong buy
industry : security , homeland security , cargo screening and explosion detection systems
recent news : sniffex , inc . announces international marketing program
do not buy this stoc - k if you want to just play it for a few days , this issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize the potential of the company and the fact that 2 - 3 contracts on government level could skyrocket the stoc - k price above $ 10 - 20 .
reason for the top 2005 rating : unique explosive detection device capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters ! ! ! there is no other eds device which is so powerful that can locate almost any explosive behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters ! !
the competition : there are many companies in the industry of sniffing explosives , some of them are public and they are companies like ison hwpr or hiet and all of them have devices which can locate explosive from 10 inches , 1 feet , 2 feet or close to that .
compared to these results sn fx device is tens of times better and smaller in size and yet cheaper ! !
snfx announced the release of sniffex version 1 . 1 , a handheld explosives detection device which the company claims can locate nitro - based explosives from a distance of 10 to 100 feet depending on the quantity of the explosive and environmental conditions .
the company also stated that , to the best of their knowledge , sniffex is the first device of its kind that can operate from such distances and find exp losives behind barriers .
could this company be amongst the top deals on wallstreet this year ! ! ! yes its trading at only $ 2 . 8 now and this brand new stoc - k could be $ 10 - 20 easily in the next few months as the story unfolds ! !
do not buy this stoc - k if you want to just play it for a few days , this issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize the potential of the company and the fact that 2 - 3 contracts on government level could skyrocket the stoc - k price above $ 10 .
snfx is in process of presenting the new device in usa and to worldwide markets and as soon as they receive some substantial orders and feedback from big institutional clients , this stoc - k will fly in the skies ,
as an example ison traded almost 1 billion dollars after they announced they are in process of developing some device , and snfx already has the device and it proved it works in numerous tests ! !
recent news announcement from the company : sniffex , inc . ( snfx ) ( sniffex ) , producers of sniffex , an explosive detection device , announced today the results of a new international marketing campaign that includes asia , australia , and the middle east .
the company stated that inquires for the product has come from at least 10 countries and that discussions have already begun on distribution agreements in several of those countries .
the company further stated that they have had significant direct interest from us government agencies and several foreign governments .
our progress as a new company has been steadily accelerating . the events of july 7 , 2005 in london have further increased the interest in sniffex and in our company ' s future products .
we believe we are at the forefront of providing new tools for effectively fighting the international war on terror , stated paul johnson , president of sniffex , inc . we are saddened by the losses that occurred in london and we are hopeful that sniffex will become a critical component in saving future lives .
this stoc - k is going to be the hottest issue for the year 2005 ! !

subject : ferc conference on el paso capacity allocation ( rpo 0 - 336 )
summary
though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to el paso ' s capacity allocation method ( including those in the pipeline ' s order 637 proceeding ) , and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline ' s allocation , major substantive issues were not covered at this conference . for instance , the battle between full requirements ( fr ) shippers and contract demand ( cd ) shippers came up marginally , but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of fr shippers to cd contracts .
procedurally , there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing , merits decision from the commission or settlement , though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision . staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions .
allocation studies ( models )
el paso opened the conference with a presentation / interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal ( march 27 ) would allocate the system ' s receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios . for nominations , receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers , and the model used 20 pools . the scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred ( based on those shipper - supplied preferences ) , solved the largest constraints first , then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation .
there were questions on the studies , what they show , what the assumptions are , etc . , and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies . shippers have requested six more allocation studies , showing possible impacts of seasonalization ( winter and summer ) and the difference between cd and full requirements coincidental and non coincidental peaks ( winter and summer , 1995 - 2000 ) .
el paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable , and in fact results in 247 mmcf / d of unallocated capacity ( 230 mmcf coming from the line 2000 expansion proposal , and an extra 17 mmcf ) . shippers were skeptical of the "" slack capacity "" finding .
other issues
? pooling : there was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to 20 pools . it was noted that this should be addressed with order 637 issues , expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved .
? fr vs . cd : though there were some fr vs . cd shippers discussions , they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the tx , nm and az shippers ( fr ) and aera energy ( cd shippers ) . there was also no mention of converting fr shippers to cd service . note : never mentioned were the cd and fr complainants ' proposals that el paso ( 1 ) dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or ( 2 ) requiring mainline system expansion for existing service ( rpol - 484 and 486 ) .
? release shippers : shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated , as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline ( which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated ) .
? receipt point designation : the question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools . when asked what commission policy is on pools vs . receipt points , both shippers and staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another - both should be available . however , staff noted that in the flexibility vs . reliability debate , it could be argued that el paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability .
procedure going forward
the primary issue here ended up being procedural .
the procedural schedule is as follows :
? el paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing : sept . 24
? initial comments ( on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations ) : oct . 15
? reply comments : oct . 26",0

interview - numerical methods & finance,"dear tanya :
it was a great pleasure to have met you . i very much enjoyed the interview and your insightfull questions .
i am keenly aware that many of the methods that i discussed with you yesterday are unique , new and not reported elsewhere . this is true both about the work i did in whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as garch . the innovations stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that i have both in turbulence physics as well as finance . they entailed considering the problem from its raw formulation , mathematical analysis , physical interpretation , taylored numerical method development , software writting and develoment and data management .
as to why i have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has been adding value to the business not publishing . publishing is however an option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the work that i did .
i not however that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the mathematics , finance , software design and data managemnet aspects of the problem . absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and execution .
please recall that as good as they were the performance measures that i mentioned to you were for a single processor machine . vastly better can be achieved with both soft parallelism ( multithreading ) as well as hard parallelism ( heterogenous network ) . this fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used .
in fact i know for a fact that better can be done than what i mentioned in the interview . from work that i have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model itm and otm instruments can be included in both the callibration , pricing and hedging .
i look forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us cooperating .
best regards

coveted reservoirs with generating potential of millions per week
aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oil and gas ( mogi ) .
montana oil and gas inc . ( other o - t - c - mogi - news )
announces that
the sylvan lake oil and gas project is still awaiting a rig at this time .
the surface
lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become
available for
over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest .
the company has a 25 % working interest in the sylvan lake project .
symbol - mogi
price - . 48
rating - strongbuy
the value of mogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripled in the last two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - millions , mogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . montana oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and developers like montana oil ( mogi ) that the biggest gains
are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple
and even quadruple returns .
vancouver , march 11 , 2 oo 5 - ( mogi ) peter sanders notes : ` ` with the prices of
oil at all - time highs and with the popularity of drilling in alberta ,
canada ,
the demand for rig and crew is at an all - time high as well ; all we can do is
be patient until a rig is secured . all permits are in place and shareholders
will be updated once drilling begins . ' '
montana oil and gas will participate in a minimum 4 - well program , on a third
for
a quarter basis , called sylvan lake , located west of red deer , alberta .
montana oil and gas '
cost per well is $ 180 , 000 , with the first well to be drilled upon rig
availability .
it is a 7 , 200 - foot peskisko sand test that is prospective for oil and in
upper pay zone ` ` shunda ' ' for gas .
each development well has probable production of a minimum 150 barrels of
oil per day
and 750 , 000 cubic feet gas per day with potential reserves in excess of 1
billion cubic feet gas
and 300 , 000 barrels oil . there are five prospective pay zones , the average
well in the sylvan lake field
has produced 500 barrels oil per day with over one million cubic feet gas
per day
good luck and successful trading .

understanding risk and return of an insurance portfolio,"hi vince ,
i am enclosing a report on my thoughts about risk and return behaviour of an
insurance portfolio . your input on this will be very helpful .
i have given vasant a copy of this report and am working with him towards
improving this . in the mean time , i happened to mention this idea in a
meeting with david porter , per sekse , brad blesie and david hoog and there
seems to be some interest in understanding how this works . in fact , david
hoog subsequently reviewed this with me and suggested some changes . those
changes have been included in this report .
the idea here is simple and just a starting point . while it provides a broad
picture on how risk and return will behave at portfolio level , i am hoping
to be able to relax some of the assumptions to get more realistic picture in
near future .
looking forward to your input ,
sincerely ,

all ,
barclays has agreed to accept cash collateral on an ongoing basis until such time we are able to post an l / c subject to the provisions stated below .
under the circumstances , i think that they have been very flexible and would be unlikely to negotiate on most of the points . we would need some clarification on point 1 ( onerous if it applies to all contracts under the current isda ) , we would expect 1 . to only apply to so 2 transactions ( written into the so 2 confirm ) .
vincent , brent , i would be grateful if you would take at a look at these points . our timeline is to get everything signed by lpm today .
